            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </p>
            <p>I had this ſuſpition alſo being a Child, when I heard or read the Hiſtory of <hi>Geneſis:</hi> Where <hi>Cain</hi> goes forth: where he ki<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Yet, although I had this doubt in my mind, yet durſt I not ſpeak any thing of it, which did not relliſh of that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived opinion, concerning <hi>Adam</hi> created firſt of all men; till I met with the 12, 13, 14 verſes of the 5 ch. of the Epiſt of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Rom.</hi> which I have in hand, and conſider of now twenty years, or thereabouts. And as he who goes upon Ice, goes warily where he cracks it, being not well frozen, or ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; but where he finds it frozen, and well hardned, wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But ſo ſoon as I knew by theſe verſes of the Apoſtle, that ſin was in the world before it was imputed; and when I knew, and that certainly, that ſin began from <hi>Adam</hi> to be imputed, I took heart, and found all this diſpute ſo ſolid, that I paſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>'d through it with leſſe fear. I found men, who beyond that imputation of ſin, which had its original from <hi>Adam,</hi> had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſinned; but their ſin was not impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb facs="tcp:62635:3"/>to them, according to the ſimilitude of <hi>Adam,</hi> to whom firſt of all ſin was impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and ſo imputed, that it was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eputed a crime to him, and to all men, and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to death.</p>
            <p>But as the nature is of things that are firm in themſelves, the firmneſſe of this Tenent appeared to me to be ſuch, that the more queſtions of Divinity I did turn it to, and thoſe the greater and moſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, ſo much the purer, greater, and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Chriſtian Religion ſhined forth to me.

               </q> A tryal of which I put forth in that Eſſay, which for that purpoſe I did compoſe, for the clearing of thoſe verſes of the Apoſtle; Nor conſidering the bulk of the work could I then make an end; Now I intend ſtill by way of Eſſay to open the body of Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty it ſelf, by which the Doctrine of the Goſpel, upon preſuppoſition of men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Adam,</hi> may be laid open more at large, and that it may appear that this Tenet is no ways diſadvantagious to our faith, which is in Chriſt; nay that it unrevelled it from
<pb facs="tcp:62635:4"/>a great many niceties, with which it's entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled, and does almoſt in every place make it clearer to our eyes and minds; Which I promiſe, without boaſting: Whether I do it, and bring it to paſſe, let the courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Reader judge.</p>
            <p>I doe not doubt but a great many perſons who ſhall ſee the title and the intention of this book, not reading the work it ſelf, with tongue and hand will ſtreight fall upon this work as a new thing, and ſtreight draw their pens, to fall upon that which they have not underſtood. To all whom I now anſwer; That whatſoe'r they write, I ſhall not anſwer them: But if there be any more calm and wiſe, as I hope there will be a great many ſuch; who ſhall refrain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; And if there be any thing in my writings which after diligent peruſal, ſhall offend them, and ſhall admoniſh me in a civil and Chriſtian way, I ſhall yeeld my ſelf wholly to them, and affording them all reſpect, ſhall endeavour to ſatisfie them. But this eſpecially, and moſt exactly I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; If any man in a known caſe ſhall ſhew me my error; that is to ſay, that I contradict the Hiſtory of <hi>Geneſis</hi> in the leaſt, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place of the holy and Orthodox ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which are contained in both the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaments,
<pb facs="tcp:62635:4"/>or ſtep aſide from them a nails breadth, or from any head of Chriſtian faith: Firſt, I ſhall thank him for his teaching of me; then I ſhall not be aſhamed to ſet down my name; nay I ſhall think it my greateſt credit to fill it with capital letter, in confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing my fault, which I deteſt, if any ſuch I have committed; For although I am my own greateſt friend, yet truth's more dear to me, which I only profeſſe. My name I do not now mention, for modeſties ſake; not as conſcious of any evil action. For I fear leſt I ſhould abuſe ſo noble a ſubject by the ſlenderneſſe of my Treatiſe; and leſt all which I ſhall ſtudy or frame upon ſuch high matter ſhould be far inferiour. But let them account, which know me, what and how great have been my toſſings up and down theſe thirty years, and what chances have drawn me in that time forward and backward. So that more by meditation, than reading, and ſerious ſtudy, as was needfull, I have at laſt finiſht this ill compos'd and undigeſted work: Therefore I intreat my Reader he will be pleaſed to take this beginning howſoever in good part.</p>

                  <p n="12">12. <hi>As by one man ſin entred into the world, and by ſin death: even it ſo paſſed upon all
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62635:11"/>men, becauſe all men had ſinned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="13">13. <hi>For until the Law ſin was in the world; but ſin was not imputed when there was no Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="14">14. <hi>But death reigned from</hi> Adam <hi>till</hi> Moſes; <hi>likewiſe upon thoſe who had not ſinned according to the ſimilitude of the tranſgreſſion of</hi> Adam, <hi>who is a type of the future.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt we muſt obſerve, that this is a ſingular place, where he intends to ſpeak of that ſin, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called original, which paſſed from <hi>Adam</hi> upon all men; nor is there any other obſerved in the whole Bible, through the whole Old and New Teſtament, where clearly and openly this ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> is handled. Hence it is proved, that <hi>Adam</hi> is meant by that man of whom the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaks, by whom ſin entred into the world, and by ſin death; by whom alſo death paſſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all men, as in him all men had ſinned. But for the ſame reaſon that the Apoſtle ſpoke of that ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> which brought guilt upon all men, it follows, that he likewiſe meant that Law in this place, the tranſgreſſion of which cauſed the ſin of <hi>Adam;</hi> as likewiſe that Law be underſtood to be the Law of <hi>Adam,</hi> which is to be thought to be given to all men: juſt ſo as all men in <hi>Adam</hi> are thought to have tranſgreſſed it. Therefore we will baniſh hence the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Law, which had nothing to doe with Original ſin, becauſe it was not given to <hi>Adam,</hi> nor to all men in <hi>Adam;</hi> and therefore the tranſgreſſion of it could not be imputed to <hi>Adam,</hi> nor to all men in <hi>Adam.</hi> And certainly the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Law was only given and publiſht to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and not to other men, the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62635:11"/>tranſgreſſion of which, ought only to have been imputed to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and not to the reſt of the Nations which were not of the kinred and family of <hi>Jews,</hi> who were not held nor tyed by any bond or Covenant. <hi>He gave his words to Jacob, and his testimonies to Iſrael; He did not ſo to all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, nor did he manifeſt his judgements to them,</hi> as ſung the Prophet in the 148 <hi>Pſalm,</hi> and many ſuch are read in holy Authors, which for brevities ſake I omit. If the Apoſtle meant here the Law of <hi>Adam,</hi> not the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſin was in the world until the Law of <hi>Adam</hi> by the ſame Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, and therefore before the Law of <hi>Adam;</hi> and it muſt be, that theſe men come to my preſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, which ſinned before the Law of <hi>Adam,</hi> or before <hi>Adam,</hi> which is the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, it is clearer than clear fire, That the Apoſtle in this place ſets down two ſorts of ſins, in time and quality different. Different in time, where he mentions ſin after the Law, and ſin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Law. Different in quality, where he meant, That ſin before the Law was not impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſin following the Law was imputed. For, ſayes <hi>Paul, Sin until the Law was in the world, but ſin was not imputed</hi> (or is not imputed, as ſome tranſlate it) <hi>when there was no Law.</hi> But if ſin was in the world until the Law, it was alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Law. And that ſin which did violate the Law, was without doubt after the Law. You ſee here ſins deſigned before and after the Iav, different in time. Again, if ſin be not imputed when the Law is not, who will ſay that that ſin was imputed which was before the Law, or which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62635:12"/>was committed before the Law? But if on the other part that was the tranſgreſſion of the Law which cauſed imputation, we ſhall call that ſin imputable which broke the Law, and ſo was after the Law. You ſee here ſins diſtinct in qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
                  <p>Sin that was not imputed before the Law, we may call <hi>Natural,</hi> ſince it depended upon no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of the Law, but had its original from the meer ill diſpoſition of humane nature.</p>
                  <p>Sin which was imputed after the Law, becauſe it had its original from the meer tranſgreſſion of the Law, let us call it <hi>Legal:</hi> And let us again call that death, which upon my ſuppoſition enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Natural ſin, <hi>Natural death;</hi> and that <hi>Legal death,</hi> which puniſhed Legal ſin.</p>
                  <p>Which that it may appear more clearly, we muſt firſt know, That humane nature is conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red two manner of wayes, right, and perverſe. Right, which had the image of innocence and perfection, in ſo farr as man could be created right and perfect. Perverſe, which turned away from the righteouſneſs of that perfection, which I call natural. We muſt know ſecondly, That the Law was appointed not to make men perfect, but to reduce men to their perfection which were depraved and corrupted; Not to make perfect, but to teach and preſcribe perfection: And thoſe whom ſhame of tranſgreſſion could not deter from miſdemeanour, fear of puniſhment might keep them within the rules of honeſty. The Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of men is directed by Law, and right reaſon. Right reaſon is natural, and born with us. The
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62635:12"/>Law is a ſtranger, and preſcribed to us. But that was born before this was written, and was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted not by opinion, but by nature. The Law teaches us that which we have forgotten, by the corruption of our Nature and Right reaſon; for we ſhould not know what were ſin, if the Law had not taught us. And hence it is, that the Law ſimply ſo called is ſtyled a <hi>School-maſter</hi> by the Apoſtle, and all other Laws are called In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, Commands, Precepts, in both Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, ſacred and prophane.</p>
                  <p>Men ſinned only with a natural ſin, before the Law, and till the Law, as oft as they fell from that perfection, to which by the nature of their crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they were born, and as oft as they erred from that right reaſon which guided them to their perfection. All men ſinned two manner of ways, after the Law, and after the Law was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to them: For firſt, they ſinned againſt that perfection of their nature; They ſinned ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, againſt the preſcript and ordination of the Law, which called them back into the right way. And this is that which I call legal ſin, and which St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 7. <hi>thinks to be the higheſt ſin againſt the Law;</hi> that is, to be a ſin againſt the Law, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree higher than the ſin againſt nature.</p>
                  <p>And whatſoever ſin there is, be it natural or legal hath its own natural or legal puniſhment at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending it. And death is the inſeparable wages of every ſin, whether you aſcribe it to Nature, or to the Law. Natural death, which is begotten by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural corruption, never fails, ſooner or later, to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertake depraved nature, which is before it. Legal
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62635:13"/>death ſits behind the Law-breaker, as an aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. And Legal ſin is as it were grafted into natural ſin, and legal death added to the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral: Legal death added to the natural, cauſes a civil death, which in imagination and ſpirit is conceivable.</p>
                  <p>Humane lawes have provided, that men ſhould not ſtray without the limits of right and perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but that they might be reſtrained within them: Divine law will'd, that men ſhould not only continue in their righteouſneſs and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but that they ſhould be advanced above their own righteouſneſs and perfection. Humane lawes have provided, that men, like beaſts, ſhould not be meerly turned to paſture: The Divine law will'd, that man ſhould be carried upward to the ſight and glory of immortal God. Humane lawes were within the limits of men: Divine lawes were above men. Humane lawes reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the nature of men: Divine lawes reſolv'd to alter humane nature. Humane lawes grafted in nature, help nature, and ſavour of nature: Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine lawes being placed above nature, breath all Myſterie and Divinitie; help nature that it may purifie it; nay, that it may turn humane nature into divine.</p>
                  <p>Let us here leave Humane lawes, and onely talk of that which God gave to <hi>Adam;</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by the myſtical, not the natural diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that Law, we become more than men, and are transform'd into gods, Which is the end of this Syſteme of Divinity and Chriſtianity. Likewiſe we ſhall handle that legal ſin, which
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62635:13"/>broke the Law of God: I ſay that firſt Law of God, which <hi>Adam</hi> the firſt man did tranſgreſs; And which men were reputed to have violated in <hi>Adam.</hi>

Conceiv'd ſpiritually, and not propagated naturally.</head>
                  <p>THere are ſome perſons who believe, that Warrs, Plagues, Fevers, and all the troop of natural corruptions, invaded the Earth by that imputation of the ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> which firſt tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed the Law of God. And much they ſtand for this, not taking notice of the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt natural and legal ſin. For Warrs, Plagues, and Fevers, and whatſoever elſe of this ſort trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and afflicts mankind, are the conſequences of natural ſin, which is the wickedneſs and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Nature. This will eaſily appear to ſuch, who will ſuffer that antient cloud of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſion to be remov'd, which dulls their ſight; for who knows not that Warrs had their original from ſuch, whom either greedy deſire of prey, or cruel thirſt after revenge, or ſacred ambition of Rule ſtirred up to take arms? Then, who hath not had experience of the breeding and inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Plagues and Fevers, either by the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62635:14"/>corruption of the air, or by the corruption of our natural bodies? We have as many witneſſes of this obſervation and truth, as we have Stateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Phyſicians, whoſe approbations, almoſt innumerable, it is needleſs here to relate.</p>
                  <p>We ſhall therefore aſſert a double ſin in <hi>Adam,</hi> a natural, and a legal. A natural ſin, naturally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in <hi>Adam,</hi> by the infirmity of his nature, and that peccant matter whereof he was made: Legal, which hapned and was imputed to <hi>Adam,</hi> by violation of the Law of God. A natural ſin, which infected the natural ſenſe, matter, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Adam:</hi> A legal, myſtical, and ſpiritual, which broke the Law myſtical &amp; ſpiritual, which only in ſpirit and reaſon could be conceived. For who can conceive a tree of good and evil? who can underſtand the eating of knowledge, the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of good and evil, unleſs he conceive it intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectually and myſtically? Likewiſe we conceive a two-fold ſin in all men, as we aſſert a two-fold ſin in <hi>Adam,</hi> natural and legal. A natural ſin, which being innate in every perſon by reaſon of his peccant nature, is deeply and naturally root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their very bowels, <hi>Which proceeds from the fat of them,</hi> as is elegantly expreſſed in the 73 <hi>Pſalm:</hi> A legal ſin, which happen'd and was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to all men by the tranſgreſſion of that Law which <hi>Adam</hi> did violate. A natural ſin, which had an influence upon the natural ſenſe and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal matter of all men: Legal, which paſs'd upon all men ſpiritually and myſtically by the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal ſin of <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We conceive that myſtical and ſpiritual paſſing
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62635:14"/>of legal ſin upon all men, by another ſin which was <hi>Adams,</hi> to have been by imputation, by which we meant, that it was imputed to all men that <hi>Adam</hi> had ſinned.</p>
                  <p>With any elſe beſides Divines, imputation of anothers treſpaſs is a meer ſuppoſition in Law, but with Divines it is the form of the myſteries: which I ſhall clear to you by a very part example; <hi>Sedechias</hi> King of the <hi>Jews</hi> brake his allegeance to the King of <hi>Aſſyria;</hi> That fault was imputed to all the <hi>Jews,</hi> who were thought perjur'd in the perjury of the King, by that ſuppoſition of the Law of Nations, by which people are thought to commit a fault in the faults of their Kings. God had entered into a Covenant with <hi>Adam,</hi> and in him with all men, as being the Governour, Defender, and Prince of all men: That Covenant <hi>Adam</hi> broke, and that failing of <hi>Adam</hi> was aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to all men by that divine way of myſterie, by which all men are thought to be delinquents in the faults of their Governours, Defenders, or Princes.</p>
                  <p>Therefore I think not that the imputation of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin did overthrow mans nature; nor doe I again agree with thoſe that will grant nothing to imputation. I leave to things natural and myſtical their own room: Natural things I would have naturally taken; Things myſtical I would have myſtically underſtood. Corruption contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from that matter of all men, which is addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to corruption, was that which overthrew the nature of mankind. The myſtical imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> is that which infected all
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62635:15"/>men with the myſtical ſtain of condemnation. I aſſert imputations, without which the myſteries of Chriſtianity would be ſubverted; but theſe I reſtrain within their myſtical limits, leſt they ſtray beyond their myſterie, beyond conception &amp; ſpirit. Therefore I think not from thence, becauſe the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> was imputed to all men, that thence they came to be obnoxious to diſeaſes; but by reaſon of their corrupt and rotten nature. The innate infirmity of men, was the real and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural calamity of men. And according to <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> Chap. 28. <hi>There came a fire out of the midſt of them, to conſume them;</hi> than which there is nothing more true; for it is a mans own nature which cauſes burnings in his heart: which that I may the more evidently prove by examples, It is not known that <hi>Adam</hi> who was the criminal, and (as they ſay) the firſt fountain of ſo great evils, was ever ſo much as troubled with the leaſt diſeaſe all the Nine hundred and thirty years which he liv'd, unleſs you will believe him, who relates out of I doe not know what Author, that <hi>Adam</hi> dyed of the Gout, with which he was troubled, and which he pretends that he had by ſucceſſion from his Anceſtors. Did <hi>Cain</hi> fall ſick when he ſlew his Brother? Nay, he was very ſtrong and luſty, he fled to the eaſt of <hi>Eden,</hi> got a company of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked perſons about him, with whom he rob'd. He married a Wife, begot a Son, and built a City. And this is a continual complaint of the Elect in the Scripture, as it were accuſing God, that he ſhews all his power to heap proſperity upon the wicked, that all things goe well with them,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62635:15"/>that things which they wiſh for come to paſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their hopes, and that no diſaſters blaſt their pleaſures and their joyes. Likewiſe the moſt excellent Poet falls out with his gods, becauſe his Miſtreſs having ſworn by them, &amp; being perjur'd, kept the ſame face which ſhe had before; that ſhe being perjur'd, had as long hair as before; that ſhe had the ſame Roſes in her cheeks, the ſame neat foot, the ſame fair and clear eyes after ſhe had injur'd the gods, as ſhe had before ſhe ſwore; Nay, after ſhe had tyed her ſelf by ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny execrations, ſhe became fairer and fairer. And certainly, the ſuppoſition of the <hi>Roman</hi> Law granted a great many, who were priſoners with the Enemy, dead in a civil ſenſe, who were not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding in good health. Therefore it is apparent, that neither ſuppoſitions of Law, nor intentions of myſterie could any jot indam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage nature; nor that the imputation of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, which is altogether myſtical and ſpiritual, was the cauſe of Plagues, Fevers, and other diſeaſes which Nature cauſes in men; but that they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen by reaſon of vitious matter, and the frame of their creation, which is ſubject to corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                  <p>ANd it is the faſhion of all Inconveniences, that one draws another; there are not thoſe wanting, who affirm, That if <hi>Adam</hi> had not ſinn'd, men ſhould never have dyed: as if immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, which is aeternal life, and which onely a new Creation could beget, as only having the power of immortality in it, could have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon men, by the force and vertue of the firſt Creation, which by its nature is ſubject to corruption and death, and that men ſhould not have dyed, who (as the Schools ſay) are natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly corruptible, and were created mortal.</p>
                  <p>Nay, ſay they, God ſaid to <hi>Adam, Eat not of the tree of good and evil: for on that day that thou ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt thereof thou ſhalt dye the death.</hi> Therefore ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they, If death was given as a punniſhment to <hi>Adam</hi> on that day wherein he tranſgreſſed the Law of God, <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould have never dyed, if he had never ſinn'd.

Truly, whether a man by the ſentence of the Judge be ſtrangled, or be beheaded, or dye upon the rack, he is firſt to be thought dead, a natural death, as being dead by natural cauſes, as ſtopping or cutting the paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of his breath: Again, becauſe to this nature a condemnation by Law is added, he is ſaid for the way of his death, to have dyed a ſecond and a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil death.</p>
                  <p>The ſame is to be thought to have happened to <hi>Adam,</hi> being condemned by the Law of God, which happen'd to other men condemned by the Laws of men. <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould have dyed a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral death, and by a cauſe meerly natural, ſince he was made up of matter corruptible and mortal. <hi>Adam</hi> dyed likewiſe a legal death by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of the Law, at which time he broke the Law of God. The natural death of <hi>Adam</hi> followed the natural ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> and the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of his corruption, ſpringing from the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible matter whereof he was made. Legal ſin made the legal death of <hi>Adam.</hi> There was a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical cauſe of that myſtical effect, which only could be conceiv'd by ſpirit and reaſon.</p>
                  <p>This ſhall be evidently prov'd by <hi>Adam</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; God had ſaid to <hi>Adam, Whatſoever day then eateſt, thou ſhalt die the death:</hi> Therefore <hi>Adam</hi> is thought to have died the very ſame day, the very ſame minute wherein he tranſgreſſed the Law of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62635:18"/>God: And yet <hi>Adam</hi> died neither naturally nor bodily that minute or that day; For we know that he liv'd Nine hundred years after he ſinned. Therefore we ſhall underſtand that <hi>Adam</hi> dyed when he tranſgreſſed the Law of God a legal and a ſpiritual death, which only could be conceiv'd in thought. <hi>Adam</hi> dyed a legal &amp; ſpiritual death when he tranſgreſſed the Law of God. <hi>Adam</hi> died a natural and a corporeal death when he had liv'd Nine hundred and thirty years, and in that ſet hour where the natural bounds of his life was fixed.</p>
                  <p>But we ſhall more eaſily underſtand that <hi>Adam</hi> dyed the death, and that a ſpiritual death was added to his natural, if we review other condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations decreed by God, both againſt <hi>Adam</hi> and againſt <hi>Eve,</hi> and againſt the Serpent, after, and for the tranſgreſſion of <hi>Adam.</hi> This puniſhment was decreed for <hi>Adam</hi> after his ſin, <hi>In labour ſhalt thou eat of the earth all the dayes of thy life:</hi> But God had plac'd <hi>Adam</hi> before he ſinned in Paradiſe, that he might cultivate it; Therefore that he might labour and manure the ground in Paradiſe before he ſinn'd, and that by his labour he might eat of it, as he did labour and manure it, and by his labour did eat of it after his ſinne. Obſerve here labour both before and after ſin. Labours before ſin, according to the nature of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>griculture natural: labours after ſin, by a myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal condemnation, which only could be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in thought.</p>
                  <p>Such is that which the Lord ſaid to <hi>Eve, I will multiply thy ſorrows, and thou ſhalt bring forth with
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62635:18"/>pain, and ſhalt be in the power of thy husband, and he ſhall be Lord over thee.</hi> The Lord multiplyed the ſorrows of the woman, when according to the condemnation he added ſpiritual and myſtical griefs to thoſe which were natural, by which a woman is naturally torn when ſhe brings forth. God multiplyed the ſubjection of the woman under the power of her husband, when he added the condemnation by Law to that natural Law by which the nobler ſex hath dominion over the inferiour.</p>
                  <p>But chiefly its worth taking notice of what God decreed againſt the Serpent, and what pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment he appointed for him for tempting <hi>Eve</hi> with eating of the forbidden fruit; <hi>Becauſe thou haſt done this,</hi> ſaith the Lord to the Serpent, <hi>thou ſhalt goe upon thy belly, and ſhalt eat duſt all the dayes of thy life;</hi> but this was naturally in the Serpent at his creation to creep and crawl; that the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent ſhould goe upon his belly, and eat the duſt: for God before ſin, nay the fifth day of the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, created all manner of creeping things, of which ſort was the Serpent, and chief of them certainly. Therefore we muſt underſtand the Serpent to have crept in two ſenſes, before ſin, and after ſin: that he crept before ſin naturally, by the nature of his creation; that he crept after ſin according to the decree of God, and by that condemnation which was onely in ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>So may we underſtand <hi>Adam</hi> to have dyed two manner of ways. Naturally, that he dyed naturally according to the firſt intention of his making before the Law. Legally and after a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62635:19"/>manner after the Law, by that decree and Law of condemnation which is ſpiritually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd.</p>
                  <p>Therefore we ſhall think that there is a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold death in all men, as we conceive to be in <hi>Adam.</hi> Natural, which happens naturally to all men by their own imbred nature, which is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible and mortal: A Legal one, which ſmote all men that minute myſtically when it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed againſt <hi>Adam.</hi> A natural death; by which men dyed naturally before the Law: a Legal death, which paſſed ſpiritually upon them after the Law, by tranſgreſſion of the Law. A natural death, which followed mans natural ſin: a Legal death, cauſed by the legal ſin of men from the ſin of <hi>Adam.</hi> A myſtical cauſe of a myſtical effect, which onely by way of ſpirit and myſtery is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable. And truly, as the Law of creeping or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd againſt Serpents in the Law of <hi>Adam,</hi> did adde nothing to the reptile nature of Serpents but a condemnation meerly ſpiritual: ſo the Law of death added nothing to the mortal nature of men, except that condemnation of death which in thought and myſtery is only conceiv'd. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,</hi> ſays <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 89. <hi>what is my ſubſtance.</hi> And a little after, <hi>What man is he that liveth, and ſhall not ſee death?</hi> which the Kingly Prophet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of natural death, the cauſes of which he aſcrib'd to the ſubſtance and matter of men, not to the ſin of <hi>Adam:</hi> adde to this, what St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath written <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>Fleſh ſavours of death;</hi> and in the 6 Chap. of the ſame Epiſtle, <hi>The wages of ſin is death.</hi> In which he meant natural ſin, and

                     </gap>tious matter, which could ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily return to its own diſpoſition.</head>
                  <p>IT ſeems not to agree with that which is ſet down in the 1 of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> That I ſaid the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of man was evill and corrupt: For there it's ſaid, that God did create man according to his own Image; and that all things which God cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated were very good; whence Interpreters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, and rightly, that man being created accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Gods own Image, was created perfect and upright. And if all that God created was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good, that man then, who was the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent of the Creatures, was exceeding good.</p>
                  <p>To this that I may anſwer; I would firſt have it granted, that the impreſſion of Gods Image in the firſt creation is different from that in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond creation. God expreſſed in the firſt Creation that firſt Image and copie of his wonderful art, by which he made the World, and all that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is, and by excellent wiſdom compos'd and pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd them. In his renewing, which is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond creation, God expreſs'd the Image of his own nature, wherein he communicated his love and bounty to the Wor'd. God in his firſt cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation ſhewed the out-ſide of his work: but in
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62635:20"/>the ſecond he opened the bowels of his love. The firſt creation expreſſed the Image of God, which we may call the exterior: the ſecond crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion preſents us with the internal Image of God. There was nothing beſides, which God did not communicate in the Image of that plat-form, and of his admirable art, which he exppreſs'd in all things which he created: But he did not make all things partake of that Image of his nature, lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e, and bounty, which be moſt worthily ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in men, when he did regenerate or when he went about to regenerate them. Furthermore whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver material or corporeal things ar created by the law of their own nature, they ar created corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and mortal; but whatſoever out of things corruptible and material, are created a new by the Law of that ſecond creation become incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and immortal.</p>
                  <p>To ſay nothing of other material and corpore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al things, it is certain, that men in the beginning were created according to the Image of God, that Image of their Creator, which we may call the Image of creation: yea, they were created according to ſuch an Image of creation, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all other Images of creation is the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent amongſt all the frames of the creatures, which more expreſly and more highly repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Creator. But we muſt confeſs, that men were created at firſt according to the exteriour Image of God, which is called nigheſt to God at a greater diſtance, in compariſon to the Image of the ſecond creation. It is true, that men were created in the beginning perfect, right, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62635:21"/>good, in as farr as men by force and vertue of their creation could be created perfect, right, and excellently good. But no man ought to be ignorant, that men were created from the beginning of corruptible matter, which might eaſily be turn'd from perfect to imperfect, from right to wrong, from good to evil, which the men which were firſt created did evidence by a ſtrong and approved example, ſince the nature of their compoſition, and their own negligence carried them, being upright made, ſo far aſide.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, ſo often as I think of this, That men being created according to the Image of God the Creator, and according to the Image of the firſt plat-form, perfect, right, and very good, by a fault in them, ingrafted by nature, did degenerare from righteouſneſs to wickedneſs, from good to evil: So often I fancy a Watch newly finiſh'd, by an exquiſite artificer curiouſly order'd, with all the parts of the jagged wheels, proportionab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>y and exquiſitely weigh'd for the juſt minutes of the hours, with a Caſe curiouſly enamelled with pictures ſet out to the life, or a purl'd lining curiouſly made, as much as in gold, or Amber, the Craftſman was able to perform: For that Watch will continue intire in all its parts, ſo long as it is not ſpoyl'd, either becauſe of the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibility of the matter whereof it is made, or the careleſneſs of the Maſter that owes it: Such was the fate of men, who firſt being created perfect, right, and very good, by the default of the matter whereof they were made, and of their fiery na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which ſet them on work, they ſtaid not in
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62635:21"/>the poſture of their creation, but departed from their perfection, and turn'd from good to evil.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>— So all by fate</l>
                     <l>Run backward, and in goodneſs ſtill abate.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>Likewiſe, I could well compare men created in the beginning, according to the Image of God, very good, to thoſe houſes of the Comedian, made with good &amp; exact work, well dreſs'd and prepar'd for durance, into which came a baſe Tenant, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, ſlovenly, and idle, which took no care of that fair houſe: For there came a ſtorm, which broke the tyles and gutters, the ſhowr waſh'd the walls, it rain'd through the ſeelings, the air rotted the work of the Carpenter; then fell down the walls, and the whole houſe, to the very foundation: and not by the fault of the Carpenter, as the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>median ſays expreſly, but by the ſluggiſhneſs of that lazie man who dwelt in it, who would not lay other tyles for thoſe that were broken, by which the habitation became more inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.</p>
                  <p>For ſuch we will conceit men to have been at firſt created, as we conceive theſe new buildings; I ſay created according to the Image of God, incorrupt, right, and good, with excellent reaſon, excellent vertue, excellent truth, and that there could be nothing added to that firſt creation of men. But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe men remov'd into themſelves and their own diſpoſition, as their nature was, their own clay, their own fleſh, wch was a matter earthly and corruptible, which refrains not from ſin, ſtraight came negligence, which deſtroyd the work of the Creator, which overthrew all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62635:22"/>of Reaſon, Vertue, and Truth in men, &amp; which changed the perfection of their Creation. And that, not by the default of the Creator, which is ſpecially to be obſerved, but by the careleſneſs of men themſelves, by which they became worſe; and being created good, had no better care of themſelves. I ſay, that idleneſs was this ſtorm to men which brought upon them hail and ſhowers, which diſcovered their ſhame, and by which they were negligent to cover themſelves. Therefore wicked deſires flowed into the Hearts of men, wicked thoughts moiſtened their Hearts; and withall, Reaſon, Vertue and Truth forſook men. And laſtly, they were putrified with their ſins. <hi>That which was good in them at their Creation departed; but the malignity of their ſubſtance continued,</hi> as <hi>Eſdras</hi> ſayes, 4 Book Chap. 1.</p>

                  <p>THerefore three things offer themſelves to be conſidered in the firſt Creation of Men. The firſt is, The matter of which Men were created and made up.

                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:62635:22"/>
                  <p>That the matter of which men were made was ſubject to corruption, did appear by the ſequel: ſince they could not continue in their perfect cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and did return from uprightneſs to wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. For this cauſe called Fleſh, which is the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Man ſimply, and in it ſelf unclean, polluted, a corruption, and meer filthineſs, in all ſacred Authors. And this is enough concerning the matter of men, ſubject to corruption, as being ſurrounded with ſuch a Cloud of Witneſſes, that if we ſhould pour them out would overwhelm us.</p>
                  <p>Let us come to the Creation of Men it ſelf. God created Men in the beginning according to his own Image, excellently good and perfect: but onely in that good and perfect Eſtate, as they are, and are created Men. He created them perfect, who wanted in them nothing of perfect men: but ſuch as by vertue and force of their Creation, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured only of that which was contained in men, not which was above them. Such things as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to men, not ſuch as belonged to God. In this I ſee not why all ought not to agree without controverſie.</p>
                  <p>Let us go to that turning of men to ſin, in which they departed from the perfection of their Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and went backward according to the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of their corruptible matter, wherein they were to die, according to the intention of their compoſition. And firſt let us ſee what God did, after he had created men perfect, and placed them in earth, having prepared likewiſe all things ready for their uſe. We ſhall know that by what
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62635:23"/>is ſaid in the 25 Chap. of <hi>Mattew</hi> of the Maſter of the Houſe, who going from home, left his Goods to be uſed by his Servants. God went from home after he had created Men perfect, that is to ſay, he left Men in the hand of their own counſel, in their own power and free-will, to do as they pleaſed. <hi>He ſuffered them to take their own wills and wayes,</hi> as it is written, Acts the fourth.</p>
                  <p>On the other ſide let us ſee what men did, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now at their own diſpoſing, and having now as I may ſay, the Law in their own hand. They did that which they were moſt likely to do. They were inclinable to evil, and the leproſie of ſinne ſtuck cloſe to them. They had no reſtraint in their lives, but following their own mindes, and tyed to their deſires, they diminiſhed the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of their Creation. Their Liberty run out into Vice; and the free Nature of Man run out at Liberty, without a reign. Their own fleſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed them, and drove them blinde-ſold; freely, and not without their own conſent, they run in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to evil courſes, and returned to the Nature of their matter which was inclinable to evil. They went from their perfection to their own hearts deſire, as the 78 <hi>Pſalm.</hi> They were created up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, againſt their own diſpoſition, and were turned from their own wicked nature, being wicked, to be good. They were turned back by the force and ſtrength of their right Creation to be good: by their own will and crooked nature, being wicked, they were turned back to wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The ſinfulneſs of Man's nature, and his
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62635:23"/>corruptible matter, drew upright men backward from righteouſneſs to wickedneſs. They did not ſtrive againſt it, as became them who were crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upright. They did not wage War with their own, genius. Their hands and their feet gave over: and then, according as the corruption of fleſhly nature carried them, they run head-long in their own Chanel, and eaſily commanded themſelves to be corrupted. Little they cared for any right way of living, right or wrong, good or bad, they ſaw nothing but what pleaſed their own fancies; and gave themſelves the Liberty of all manner of ſin. Men fell through their own wickedneſs; and that I may ſpeak with <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> Chapter 28. <hi>They gave free reigns to their own dispoſition, as horſes furiouſly ruſhing to the battel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Men returned for this reaſon to their own incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, becauſe in the firſt Creation, it being on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly corrected and amended, and the vitiouſneſs of it not quite weeded out in the framing of man, and the nature of him, it was alwayes in poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, not being quite taken away, to return into it ſelf. But whatſoever was good in man, by the correcting of his faultineſs, or any perfection which he had by his Creation, was quite loſt in men, being enſlaved to their own wills; but what was evil in their clay and compoſition ſtill remained. The uprightneſs of men periſhed; and their ſin defaced them, being ſo well crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And the fault which was left in their cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and not quite rooted out in the firſt cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of man, was a leven in their hearts, more
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62635:24"/>powerfull than their Creation, by which they were altogether ſwelled and depraved. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, thoſe things are ſtronger, which move us inwardly, than thoſe things which work upon us outwardly. The perfection of the Creation of Men, flowed from God, and happened to man externally, as a thing diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, nay, quite contrary to the fleſh and matter of men. On the contrary, the faultineſs of the clay and compoſition, cleaved to them more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, as a thing proper and natural to Men. Therefore men returned to their nature, becauſe they did, according to their own diſpoſition, which was ſhown them from within. As alſo, becauſe the faultineſs of their inward nature did more ſtrongly move them, than the perfection of their creation outwardly conferred upon them; yea, becauſe the fleſh and matter of man was reprobate Earth, the Mother of good ſeed, and the Mother of ill weeds. The ſtep-mother of all Vertues which God in his creation had ſown in the hearts of men, and the mother of all Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which naturally ſpring in them, as in their native ſoyl, and, which, like watred Herbs, grow moſt plentifully. The curſed ſtep-mother hates her Sons-in-Law, but like a very loving mother embraces and foſters her Children. Hence it happened, that nature and the fleſh of man refuſed that tryed and choyce ſeed of perfection, with which they were created; and that, by the ſame nature it returned again into it ſelf, when it found liberty. And that in this regard it was far eaſier to do evil than good. From
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62635:24"/>thence the heart of man was over-run with the briers and thorns of all maner of Vices proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from their clay and compoſition.</p>
                  <p>This returning of man from the perfection of their creation, to the wickedneſs of their nature and fleſh, is that natural ſin which we mean; whether we may call it natural, becauſe it is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally inherent to us, or, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it dwells in us: Becauſe there is a Law in the members of men, leading men captive to the Law of ſin, which is in their members.</hi> Where note, the Law of natural ſin, fixed in the members of men, or the natural Law of ſin, inherent in the fleſh and nature of men. In which ſenſe it is to be underſtood, 7 Chap. to the <hi>Romans.</hi> Or whether that may be called a natural ſin, becauſe it was a declination from that nature &amp; Law of perfection, in which men were created in the beginning. For which cauſe, and moſt properly it might be called a ſin.</p>
                  <p>That there remains yet ſome foot-ſteps of this perfection in the hearts of men; yea, that men are ſtruck with a natural and tacit conſcience of it, is manifeſt; becauſe all thoſe who are formed of a better and more perfect mould, are natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more averſe from all ſin, who ſeem by the ſent to hunt and track that perfection, to which they perceive themſelves created, and from which they are fallen, by the ſtudy of vertue. In which ſenſe, the Apoſtle is chiefly to be underſtood, in ſuch places as he ſayes, <hi>Men naturally accuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and are to themſelves a Law.</hi>

God commanded men by a ſecond creation to paſs, as I may ſo ſay, from men to Gods, to be carried from corruption to incorruption, from death to eternal life: And, which was the chief bleſſing of God to man, he commanded them, of wicked, evil, and bemyred creatures, to be exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the perfection of his holineſs and glory; to which they ſhould, as with a fiery Chariot, be carried by the Spirit of Regeneration: Nay, if we rightly weigh the councel and decree of God, we ſhall find it his ſecond intention, to create men mortal and corruptible, but his firſt to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62635:25"/>them incorruptible and immortal. Creation was a thing divine: Regeneration was a thing more excellent and divine, according to that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of proportion by which incorruptible is preferrible to corruptible, and immortal prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to mortal.</p>
                  <p>But, that I may rehearſe from the beginning all the buſineſs, as it concerns Chriſtian doctrine, we muſt know, that two things occur, in the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and framing things, worthy obſervation, which are not demonſtrated by their cauſes, but are aym'd at in the Scriptures, and appear by their effects. One, which immediately flow'd from God: another, created by God but me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly. One, produc'd: another, made. One, ſpiritual: another, animal, material, carnal and corporeal. One, permanent, ſtable, eternal: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother mutable, ſubject to vanity. One, incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible, which purifies: another, corruptible, which pollutes. One, which favours of life: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, which ſavours of death. One, which is able to endure that celeſtial Lightning with which God thunders, and which ſhines in his ſight, like gold in the fire: another, which God conſumes with his ſplendor, and which melting at his rayes, departs into froth, ſmoak, and aſhes. One thing, which God loves: another, which he diſdains. One, which he chuſes: another, which he rejects. One, which St. <hi>Paul, Cor.</hi> 1. chap. 2. calls <hi>The Spirit which is of God:</hi> another, which the ſame Apoſtle calls in that very place, <hi>The Spirit of this world.</hi> Theſe two are at continual variance, and eternal diſcord, ſince God made a mixture of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62635:26"/>all things, when he gave to all things breath and life.</p>
                  <p>The Spirit which is of God, we ſhall call that Spirit of regeneration, which flows immediately, and is produced from God, which is altogether ſpiritual, ſtable, incorruptible, and eternal, which is fed with the fire of the viſion of God, which God onely loves and chuſes. We ſhall call the ſpirit of this world, that ſpirit of creation with which the whole world was animated, and which was infus'd into the whole frame in the creation, Then that is the Spirit, which by interpoſition of a <hi>medium,</hi> being created by God, is animal, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial, carnal, and corporeal, which is changeable and ſubject to vanity, which is corruptible, which ſavours of death, which faints and melts before the eyes of God, which God diſdains and rejects.</p>
                  <p>God, when he made the world, breath'd upon all things created, and living in the world, by that Spirit of the world and creation by which they live; but did not likewiſe infuſe into all things created and living in the world, his Spirit of regeneration, by which things created and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, which are antient, are renewed, the corrupt refreſh'd, and the dead riſe up into eternal li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>THe Spirit of regeneration is the ſame Spirit which is the Spirit of Chriſt, by whom comes regeneration; he is one neither enduring number nor conſort. The Apoſtle tells us, that there are ſeveral ſpirits of creation, both in the heaven and in the earth, <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. chap. 8. which in that place he calls <hi>Gods, and Lords.</hi> The words of St. <hi>Paul</hi> are theſe, <hi>For although there be thoſe which are called gods both in the heaven and in the earth, ſeeing there are many gods and many lords, yet wee have but one God.</hi> The ſame Apoſtle in the 8. to the <hi>Romans,</hi> call'd thoſe Gods and Lords in the heaven and in the earth, <hi>heighth and depth:</hi> whom he makes mention of amongſt the Spirits of the creation; for he addes <hi>Nor any other creature.</hi> And certainly, as the ſame St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſets down wicked Spirits amongſt the celeſtial, you may likewiſe imagine, that there are evil Spirits like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe amongſt the terreſtrial. For ſeeing you read <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. Chap. 28. <hi>That the Witch ſaw Gods,</hi>
                     <pb n="32" facs="tcp:62635:27"/>that is, Spirits, <hi>aſcending out of the Earth.</hi> The chief of thoſe Spirits is he, whom the holy Writ commonly calls the Devil, Sathan, Belial, Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, Prince of the power of the air, of this world and this life. That every one has their Angel and attendant, the books of both the Old and New Teſtaments doe witneſs. <hi>Jude</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle tells us, that the chief of theſe Spirits, and all the Angels under his command were created in the beginning good and upright, as alſo that they were made with a creation changeable, and corruptible, in his Catholick Epiſtle, in which place he ſayes expreſly, <hi>That thoſe Spirits did not keep their Principalitie, but left their habitation.</hi> Therefore it is to be preſum'd, that they had a good Principality, which they kept not. Hence that of <hi>Job, Behold thoſe which ſerve him are not ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and he finds wickedneſs in his Angels.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>According as thoſe ſpirits breath'd upon thoſe things which were ſubject to the Lawes of the creation, and as the Apoſtle ſpeaks in the ſecond to the <hi>Epheſians, wrought upon them,</hi> it is credible, that all the created things of the world degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from that perfect good &amp; uprightneſs where in they were created, when thoſe Spirits fell from their Principalitie and habitation; And hence it has come to paſs, that the men of the firſt crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion forgetting their firſt Creator, and ſtirr'd up by thoſe Spirits of the corrupted creation, ſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the uprightneſs of their firſt creation, and periſh'd in their own thoughts.

                  <p>Who will wonder then, that men being left by God, after their creation, in their own power, and turn'd over to ſo many Spirits, Gods, and Lords, who ſet them a work, did appoint and worſhip ſo many ſeveral ſorts of Gods, under ſo many divers ſhapes of things created, if he conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the almoſt innumerable affinities and ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies which men are found to have with theſe Spirits, Gods and Lords; as alſo with all things created in heaven and in earth?</p>
                  <p>God abborr'd thoſe Spirits and Gods, fallen off from the uprightneſs, and perfection of their creation, to their own changeable condition, with ſuch an abomination, as the moſt upright and beſt muſt needs hate that which is evil and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. Therefore you ſhall hear theſe Gods in Scripture, call'd wicked Spirits, wickedneſſes, ſpirits of error, evil ſpirits, and very evil ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; as in that 9th Chapter of the <hi>Judges, God ſent a very evil spirit betwixt</hi> Sichem <hi>and</hi> Abime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech: call'd likewiſe vain and lying ſpirits, cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,

                  <p>As alſo the holy Scriptures are clear witneſſes, that thoſe Spirits, Gods and Lords, by the Law of their creation, which is changeable and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible, are mortal, and that they are condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to eternal death; where wicked and perverſe men are called <hi>The ſons of Belial,</hi> Sam. 1.

                  <p>THe Apoſtle deduces the ſtain of all ſins which overthrew men, chiefly from this Chap. 1 E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt. to the <hi>Romans,</hi> becauſe they had left God the Creator, and had given themſelves over to thoſe Gods, Lords, and unclean Spirits. Hence their minds were blinded, and given over to their own luſts, were ſet on fire with wicked and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful deſires, contrary to nature, and ſo receiv'd in themſelves the rewards of their ſin; and thence open'd ſuch a wide door to wickedneſs and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs, that at laſt they fell into all manner of ſin. And as they preferr'd their own luſt to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God: ſo on the contrary, he gave them up to a reprobate ſenſe, that being men, they ſhould

                  <p>Truly men being miſled by thoſe Spirits, &amp; being thruſt forward by the violence of their own appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, according to the affection and ſympathie w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> they have with thoſe Spirits; I ſay, men opreſt with the weight of their own ſin, and drownd in ſticking clay, might have deſpaird of any ſalvation, nor ever have pluckt out their feet for thence, if God had not helped them, and ſtretched out his powerful hands from heaven to draw the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence: But God was not of that mind, as moſt men are, who rid an unhappy perſon from his preſent calamity, and are never ſollicitous afterwards to advance their condition. God dealt better and more freely with men: firſt, he waſh'd them, drawn out of the puddle, with his own living waters, then advanc'd them, being now clean and white, by his own free merit; and laſtly from their foul wallowings, receiv'd them into the glory of heaven, and made them partakers of divine knowledge, ſanctity, and immortality, which is in his moſt happy viſion. And this he did by vertue and force of that Spirit which is of God, and who is God himſelf, by a ſecond and new creation, out of his own free will, largeneſs of his bounty, abundance of his love, and meer grace, which therefore is call'd the gift of God, and his only free grace.</p>

                  <p>Therfore let all thoſe who deſire to know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, here make a ſtand, and endeavour to be free in their thanks to God; Let them taſt and ſee how ſweet the Lord is; Let them remember, by how great mercies, beyond their deſert, he has oblig'd mankind: Let them conſider that they are living ſouls, <hi>and that ſuch perceive not the things which are of God, nor can underſtand thoſe things which are ponder'd by the Spirit,</hi> Cor. 2.1. That worldly wiſdom is call'd <hi>Devilliſh</hi> by St. <hi>James,</hi> Chap. 3. and oppoſite to divine wiſdom; <hi>that fleſh and blood cannot diſcover the myſteries of God, but God who is in heaven,</hi> Matth. 16. Therefore let them conſider with themſelves how great their weakneſs is, in knowing God, <hi>That they are clouds driven with winds,</hi> which as St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſays, <hi>are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried about with the wind of every doctrine,</hi> and are not conſtant to one God. That they cannot from themſelves receive <hi>the spirit of truth, becauſe they neither ſee him, nor know him,</hi> in the Goſpel according to St. <hi>John,</hi> Chap. 16. Nay, they know not themſelves, <hi>That they know not the ways of the the ſpirit, nor know how their bones were ſet together in their mothers womb.</hi> Eccleſ. 11. But <hi>if they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not their own wayes, how ſhall they underſtand the ways of the Lord?</hi> Prov. 20.

Therefore let them think with themſelves, that of themſelves they are deſtitute of help and means to find out God; that they are blind, and darkned in the knowledge
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:62635:31"/>of him, for whom, according to their deſert, and the words of St. <hi>Peter, the obſcurity of darkneſs ſhould be reſerv'd.</hi> Let them hence take occaſion to bleſs God, ſo goo and ſo mercifull, who has prevented and aſſiſted men that knew him not, and hath of his own accord offer'd himſelf to be known by them: yea, that has taught them his wayes, and hath, as one friend ſpeaks to another, ſpoken to them plainly.</p>
                  <p>Let them again conſider, how wicked the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of their hearts are, <hi>All men and all the world naturally wicked,</hi> S. John 1. cap. 5. <hi>ſetled in the dregs of their own matter.</hi> Wiſd. 1. That they drink fin as fiſhes drink water. That their devices and thoughts are evil <hi>from their youth,</hi> Gen. 8. that 'tis by their own nature and diſpoſition. But as the <hi>Ethiopian</hi> changeth not his skin, nor the Leopatd his ſpots, becauſe they are naturally born with him, no more can men do good having learned e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, evil being likewiſe born in them, that by the help of their nature they are perverſe, and by their inbred wickedneſſe; that the will of the fleſh is contrary to the will of God; and that therefore the wiſdom of the fleſh is enmity to God, and is not ſubject, <hi>nor can be made ſubject,</hi> to the Law of God, as the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. That they are hard, and their necks a cord of iron, which deſpiſe the uprightneſs of their creation, and could not ſubmit to the harſh yoke of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Law. Let them again remember, that God is not only juſt and upright, as men were created in the beginning juſt and upright, but, which is moſt high, above all men, that he is moſt holy,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:62635:31"/>to whom all ſins are moſt odious, abominable, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable. Let them therefore extol the bounty and liberality of God, who notwithſtanding hath ſo dealt with men that he has freely come to theſe wicked and reprobate ſinners, and has not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd with the kiſs of Juſtice and Peace to breath upon them a part of his Sanctity.</p>
                  <p>At laſt, let them thus think, <hi>that man is rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the ſon of man but a worm,</hi> and that God hath made man in vanity: that they are graſs, and fade like the flowers of the field; yea, that like Hay, to which they are compar'd, they are out down, from morn till night. That men are feeble, altogether nothing; that they dwell in houſes of clay, which have no foundation, and which are conſumed, as with a moth; that their ſubſtance is vain like ſtubblé, which is conſumed with the breath of the fire, and that they at laſt, by the ſin of their corruptible nature, of neceſſity die; or, which is the ſame, that all of them drink deep of death and neceſſity; And that their nature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as it were flax before God, who is a conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming fire, before whom the frame of humane nature ſhakes, is chang'd by a miracle into that fiery nature of God himſelf, by vertue of which they are fed with the moſt glorious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of him. And what is moſt glorious in men, that their mortality is chang'd into immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, that they may be eternally ſatisfied with glory.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, let them conſider with themſelves, that they were created in the beginning right and perfect, but only with that righteouſneſs and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:62635:32"/>perfection, which is contained within the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of men, and with ſuch a corruptible diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, that from the top of their circle and their perfection they fell headlong into the centre of corruption and imperfection. But if they, being created right and perfect, could not retain their righteouſneſs and perfection, how much leſs could they, being wicked, attain to thoſe things which were above their righteouſneſs and perfection? I ſay above it, as far as heaven is from the earth, the creation from the Creator, and God from man; yea, there was a ladder given them to climb up to heaven, or ſwiftneſs of wings to flie up to God. By what intellect of their own, or by what cleer eye of the mind, could ever they gain the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, unto whom no man can find the way, and who have not the leaſt knowledge of themſelves? by what diſpoſition or nature of their own, could they attain to the holineſs of God, <hi>who do that evil which they would not?</hi> Rom. 7. By what confidence of their own, or conſcience of goodneſs, could they ſeize upon immortality, the cauſes of which are ſo far diſtant from them, that they cannot lengthen the appointed bounds of their lives one moment, or one ſcruple of time? Let them therefore confeſs themſelves utterly unable to compaſs great bleſſings, and plac'd at ſuch a diſtance from them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let them more ſubmiſsly and fervently wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God, who has ſo bountifully and liberally ſupplyed their wants and their weakneſs.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. IX.</head>
                  <head type="sub">The Regeneration of men is the grace and gift of God. It is not granted to all men to be regenerated, but onely to the elect. Election is in things na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural. Divine Election is in God's elect. Who are elected. And who are called Reprobates.</head>
                  <p>THerefore let us be aſſured of this, Divine Knowledge, Sanctity, and Immortality, of which the ſalvation of Man conſiſts, could never be procured for man-kinde, by the force of the firſt Creation, in which men were created perfect, as being placed above Humane perfection: But that theſe things are beſtowed upon men, by the meer liberality and bounty of God, and that they are carried away to the poſſeſſion of ſo great riches by the Spirit and power of Regeneration, which is man's ſecond Creation.</p>
                  <p>But although God, as I ſaid before, did not breath that Spirit upon all things created, but gave it particularly to men. Neither hath he yet given that Spirit to all men, by vertue of which they may know God, as he is, by the eſſicacies of which all men may be holy as God is holy, by whoſe power, laſtly, all men may gain eternal life, which is Divine immortality. Yea, God has onely imparted that Spirit to elected men, whom he has advanced from the degree and rank of men, to the higheſt rank and degree above all men, whom he had adorned with his Divine Gifts, with his Knowledge and Holineſs, and taken them into
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:62635:33"/>his fellowſhip, as Gods: ſo that moſt truely and fitly we may ſay of this, that God who is the Lord of all things, yet is the God of very few, and only of the Elect.</p>
                  <p>Election is in all things created. Things that have a living ſoul are more elect than thoſe which have not; Then of things animated, ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives. As alſo in ſtones and metals, one ſtone in better than another: one metal better than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. There is alſo elected earth, and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate earth. The choiceneſs is in choicer flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers both for colour and ſmell. The Cedar is more choice than the ſhurb: the true than the wild vine, and the pleaſant fruits of Trees are ſweeter than the wilde ones. Among Creatures, Lions excel in ſtrength; Harts, in ſwiftneſs; Lambs, in mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Amongſt Birds, Nightingals excel for ſinging, the Eagle for flight. As likewiſe of the fleſh of beaſts and birds, ſome make choicer diſhes than others. What ſhall I ſay of men? Some are more commendable for the gallantry of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity: ſome higher ſpirited than others, fairer, more noble, more fortunate in honour and riches: others more excellent in the ſtudy of Vertue, in cleerneſs of wit, and knowledge of things. There is likewiſe an election in life, and permanency of things. Some things quickly grow and quickly fade. The Crow lives nine times the juſt age of a Man. The Hart lives four times the life of the Crow. The Rook lives thrice the life of the Hart. The Phenix lives nine times the Rook's life. And if we believe the moſt ancient Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions before <hi>Heſiod</hi>'s times, The Hamadryades
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:62635:33"/>lives ten times longer than the Phoenix. To theſe adde if you pleaſe, the life or duration of Heaven and Earth, and that eviternal Marriage by which the Heaven deſcends into the lap of the Earth, and by which the Earth fructifies with continual Buds towards Heaven, and the order of the Stars ſurrounding the Heaven from aeternity, as alſo the unwearied motions of the Sun and Moon by which they are inceſlantly mov'd, and by which eviternity it ſelf is accounted.</p>
                  <p>But the Divine Election is not in all theſe created things. I ſay, that Election by which God did elect to himſelf all men, which is not of kin or blood with the firſt Creation, which ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes all kinde of things created, and is infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly above them: and which is the Election of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, that is of the ſecond Creation, not of the firſt. Certainly, if there be any thing in the firſt Creation, either exquiſite, precious or choice, delicate, ſtrong, high, or fair, or noble, or fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, or abſtruſe in wiſdom, or long in continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, of permanency and life: That is in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Creation, much more exquiſite beyond ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitneſs, far more precious beyond preciouſneſs, far more choice beyond choiceneſs, far more deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate beyond dalicateneſs, far more ſtrong beyond ſtrength, far more fair beyond fairneſs, far more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble beyond nobility, far more fortunate beyond fortune, far more wiſe beyond wiſdom, far more permanent beyond permanency.</p>
                  <p>But of this we muſt hear <hi>Baruch,</hi> Chap. 3. of his Book, <hi>Where are,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>the Princes of the Nations that have Dominion over the Beaſts of the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:62635:34"/>Earth, who treaſure up ſilver and gold, wherein men truſt? they are rooted out; the ſons of</hi> Agar <hi>have ſought for wiſdom, which is of the Earth, idle ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and ſeekers out of underſtanding. They were thoſe which from the beginning were called Giants, men of great ſtature, great warriours. Thoſe the Lord hath not choſen.</hi> He ſayes, The Election of God was not towards Kings and Princes of Nations, not towards learned Men, and excellent in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane wiſdom, not towards the Rich and Noble, not towards the ſtrong and the Renowned, thoſe famous Thunderbolts of War, becauſe they ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled that Law of Nature and their firſt Creation, by which all men are born and created to die, and attained not to that Eternal Life, which conſiſted in the power of Divine Election, and the vertue of the ſecond Creation.</p>
                  <p>God is ſaid to chuſe and to take to himſelf thoſe whom he intends to frame a-new, and to new create them; to whom he made manifeſt and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered himſelf, whom he has gifted with his ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity, whom he has made partakers of his immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality and Life Eternal, and whom from Men he advanced to be Gods. Moreover, God is ſaid to reject thoſe, and to caſt them out, whom he is pleaſed to create, but not to regenerate, into whoſe hearts he has not ſhined, whom he ſuffers to live defiled with the pollution and wickedneſs of their fleſh, whom being ſubject to the power of Death, he has not redeemd from Death, and whom he ſuffers not to ſavour any thing above man.</p>
                  <p>Not to elect, ſignifies, <hi>to reject</hi> and <hi>caſt out,</hi> which is common in ſacred Authors. <hi>Samuel</hi>
                     <pb n="47" facs="tcp:62635:34"/>comming into the houſe of <hi>Jeſſe,</hi> that he might anoint one of them, whom he knew not, King o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as ſoon as he ſaw <hi>Eliab, Jeſſe</hi>'s firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, in whoſe countenance was a royal majeſtie, ſtraight he believ'd that he had been choſen by God; But God admoniſhes <hi>Samuel, Look not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the countenance of</hi> Eliab, <hi>for I have rejected him.</hi> Sam. 1. Chap. 16. <hi>I have rejected him,</hi> is in that place directly, I have not choſen him. This will more clearly appear by the Goſpel of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> Chap. 24. concerning the judgement of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and Reprobate, which ſhall be in the day of the Lord, <hi>Then,</hi> ſayes the Evangeliſt, <hi>one ſhall be taken, another left; ſhall be left,</hi> in that place is cleerly the ſame which <hi>is cast off and rejected.</hi> Thus prayed <hi>Solomon,</hi> 1 Kings 8. <hi>Let our God be with us, not leaving us, nor caſting us off, but enclining our hearts towards him:</hi> where obſerve firſt, <hi>to leave and reject,</hi> with the moſt wiſe Prince, are the ſame. Mark ſecondly, <hi>That God enclines the heart of man:</hi> which again when he does not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline, he is ſaid to <hi>harden,</hi> as alſo <hi>to hate</hi> when he does not love. As that is to be underſtood, <hi>I have loved</hi> Jacob, <hi>and hated</hi> Eſau. Laſtly, that is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable place in the Prophet <hi>Jeremy,</hi> where he brings in God threatning deſtruction to the <hi>Jews, I will,</hi> ſayes the Lord, <hi>turn my back, and not my face to them in the day of their deſtruction:</hi> There, to turn his back to the <hi>Jews,</hi> is to fight againſt them; to leave, forſake, and fly from the <hi>Jews,</hi> is to overthrow, caſt them down, and deſtroy them.</p>
                  <p>Men therefore rejected and reprobate, are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſuch who are left by God, which is the ſame
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:62635:35"/>with not elected, or not receiv'd. Which way of expreſſion is familiar to Lawyers, with whom, <hi>to accrue,</hi> is not <hi>to decreaſe,</hi> and propertie of <hi>increaſe</hi> is propertie of not <hi>decreaſing:</hi> So it is amongſt Divines, but contrariwiſe; whatſoever glory and felicity is obtained by the Elect, by their regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, beſides the privilege of their creation, is ſaid to be impair'd in other men, to whom it is granted to be men only, but nothing granted to them extraordinary, or more than men.</p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> has given us a very good reaſon of this Election, in that exquiſite place of the <hi>Romans,</hi> in which he has put all things created in the hands of God, as clay is in the hands of the Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when he makes of one lump one veſſel to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, another to diſhonour. And if we will lay our account well, we ſhall never ſpeak ſo highly of the goodneſs and mercy of God, but his boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and goodneſs will ſtill exceed it towards all his creatures; whether he has only imparted to them the honour of creation, or ſuper-added the glory of regeneration. Yea, there is nothing ſo abject in nature, which is not created to the honour, and to the great honour of God. And as a Potter deals not unworthily with that clay which he frames not to the gracing and adorning of Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boards, unleſs by way of compariſon, when a veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel paſſes from the Wheel to an uſe not diſgrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but perchance leſs noble: So God intended no injury or diſgrace to thoſe things which he cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, though he made them leſs honourable, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs that be thought a diſgrace, which is rather a privation of honour: As for example, to things
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:62635:35"/>without life it is an honour to have been created by God. It is an honour to a vegetable to be ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, but to it likewiſe a diſgrace not to be ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated with the honour of a ſenſitive: but it is likewiſe an undervaluing to the ſenſitive, not to ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e to the degree of a rational. It is an honour to a rational man that by his reaſon he excels o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creatures, but to him likewiſe it is a diſgrace not to be choſen to that ſecond honour of creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by which the intellect exceeds reaſon, and one man exceeds another, by a moſt high degree of glory. But thou, O man, what art thou, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineſt of God, and expoſtulateſt with him, who has been pleas'd to allow thee the honour of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, although he have not likewiſe choſen thee to the glory of regeneration?

                  <head type="sub">Divine election is conſider'd two manner of ways, in God, and in myſtery. One is from eternitie; The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther only diſtributed according to myſtical occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The one admits of all men indifferently; The other first choſe the <hi>Jews,</hi> and in them all the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the world.</head>
                  <p>THat divine Election which is done by rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, and which is properly a paſſing of men from men into gods, is conſidered two man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of wayes, either in God, or in the myſterie.
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:62635:36"/>Election in God is from eternity, according to the Apoſtle, in the Chap. 1. of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> in which he ſayes, <hi>The Elect were before the creation of the world.</hi> Where there is no regard to Nation or perſon, according to St <hi>Paul,</hi> Coloſſ. 3. <hi>That with God there is neither Jew nor Gentile, cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion nor uncircumciſion, Barbarian nor Scythi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, bond nor free:</hi> To which likewiſe adde that to the <hi>Romans, With God there is no respect of perſons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Election in myſterie is perfected in myſtical diſpenſation of time, with a myſtical regard to the Nation, or with a myſtical acception of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons by which God did firſt impart his myſtical E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, to men peculiarly Elected: from whom it pleas'd him to derive the ſame Election, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate it, as from it's fountain, upon all men of all Nations, by a myſtery and decree to us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known; which God has kept ſecret, <hi>and laid up in his treaſury,</hi> as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſayes in his Song. For which let us not go to find out his wayes, which are unſearchable, and ſpeak nothing of him which relliſhes not of the holy Scripture, as far as it is granted to men to be wiſe in them.</p>
                  <p>But that for certain, and undoubtedly is ſet down in the Scriptures, that God preferr'd the Nation of the <hi>Jews</hi> in his Election, before the men of all other Nations. I ſay, in that Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which conſiſted in the true knowledge of God, divine ſanctity, regeneration, and reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection to life eternal. Of the teſtimonies of which thing, the Books of both Teſtaments are full, the chiefeſt places of which in the progreſs of this Syſteme, in their own places, and ever
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:62635:36"/>one in their own order, I ſhall not ſlightly paſſe over. It appears likewiſe by the Scriptures, that myſtical rivers of myſtical Election flow'd from the Jews and Jewiſh Nation, upon all Nations, and men of all Nations; which I ſhall make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by moſt cleer arguments, when I ſhall come to handle the Election of the Gentiles.</p>
                  <p>That Election which is in God from eternity, comes by Chriſt: as Chriſt is a Spirit purely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from God: a Spirit proceeding ſtable, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible, eternal; by whom indifferently the Jews and Gentiles were elected, regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and riſe again. The Election in myſtery, which is reveal'd in myſtical diſtribution of time, is accompliſh'd by the ſame Chriſt, becauſe that Spirit was made man and fleſh; Becauſe, I ſay, that man of <hi>Judea,</hi> was born of the choice ſeed of the Jews, from whom myſtical Election did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed; as alſo, becauſe he was rejected by the Jews, condemned, and crucified: he on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide rejected the Jews, and took in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which had not been elected; and becauſe he ſhall fully take in both Jew and Gentile, when he ſhall return in the Spirit; and becauſe when his time is come, he ſhall raiſe both Jews and Gentiles, being regenerate, with his perfect holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and crown them with eternal life. God choſe the Jews and the Gentiles in his eternal Election, without making any difference betwixt Jew and Gentile. God preferr'd the Jews be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Gentiles in that Election, which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted in the myſtical occaſions of time: Yea, God again choſe the Gentiles by a myſtical E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:62635:37"/>whom he had choſen in the Jews before; inaſmuch as he adopted ſtraugers into the Family of the Jews; or inaſmuch as he grafted a wild O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live in the Olive-ſtock of the Jews, which is St. <hi>Pauls</hi> compariſon, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.</p>
                  <p>God choſe thoſe Jews and Gentiles by an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Election, into whom, without any diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Nation, he from eternity infus'd that Spirit which is of God, a Spitit proceeding, ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, incorruptible, eternal; by the vertue of which they might be regenerate, and adorn'd with the glory of immortaſity. The Spirit of Chriſt is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd into the ſouls of the Elect, as the vegetative faculty grows up with Trees and Plants: and as the rational faculty, being joyned to vegetative and ſenſitive is added to the faculties of men. That ſoul, again, is more ſpiritly, which conſiſts of moſt faculties. As for example, The ſoul of a brute is more ſprightly than the ſoul of a Plant; becauſe a Brute ſurpaſſes a Plant in its ſenſitive faculty. The ſoul of a Man is more ſprightly than the ſoul of a Brute, becauſe he ſurpaſſes it by his reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble faculty. Therfore the ſouls of the Elect are moſt ſpiritly, above the ſouls of all other men; becauſe the Elect ſurpaſſe all other men, by the Spirit of Chriſt, by the Spirit of Regeneration, and that Spirit which proceeds from God: Which for that cauſe the Kingly Prophet called <hi>the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Spirit,</hi> Pſalm 51. By vertue of which, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect are called <hi>Spiritual;</hi> yea, ſpiritual in their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, by a reſurrection to a ſpiritual and eternal life.</p>
                  <p>The manner of compoſition of matter and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:62635:37"/>of Spirit is utterly different; For that matter which hath moſt materials caſt upon it, ſwells to be bigger, but that Spirit becomes more pure and clear which is compos'd of moſt Spirits: And as in Arithmetick to multiply a minute is to to diminiſh it, and divide it into ſubtiller parts: ſo that Spirit which is multiplyed, and rarified by more Spirits, becomes more ſubtil. The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt is added, yea multiplyed and ſubſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in the Elect, as it was multiplyed in <hi>Eliſha,</hi> and as it was taken from <hi>Moſes,</hi> and added to the ſevent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Truly I beleeve that Spirit of Chriſt which is infus'd into the Elect, to have been that Leven laid up into three meaſures of meal, of which ſpeaks the Goſpel according to St. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi> Chap. 14. I ſay that <hi>Leven,</hi> becauſe it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes, and is multiplyed in the Elect; becauſe it is mix'd with thoſe three faculties of the ſoul, which are in men the rational, ſenſitive, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getative.</p>
                  <p>The Spirit of Chriſt, who from eternity is in the Elect by an eternal election, without diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Nations, is in them the ſtrength and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of regeneration, reſurrection, and eternal life. That ſtrength is ſhow'd forth, and that power is brought unto act by a myſtical election, and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical diſpenſations of time; by which the Jews were firſt elected, the Nations being refus'd and rejected: which Jews by turn being ejected and neglected, the Gentiles were taken into the place of the Jews, and by which afterwards the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:62635:38"/>Jews and the Gentiles in one body ſhall be joyn'd together in one Election, and by whch at laſt the regeneration of both ſhall be perfected, that at the end of time God may grant unto them both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, and life eternal, without difference of Jew or Gentile<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which ſhall be the return from that myſtical Election, to eternal Election, the end and conſummation of all myſteries.</p>
                  <p>The end then of this Syſteme which I muſt handle and bring about, is ſet down in that myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Election which was firſt fram'd to the Jews, and into which the Gentiles came, thruſting out the Jews, that both Jews and Gentiles, at laſt, might come into one full ſalvation. I ſay, all this diſpute ſhall be concerning the Jews and the Gentiles.

Which ſalvation being propounded to all men in <hi>Adam,</hi> men never had received it, if <hi>Adam</hi> had not loſt it. Certainly, Regeneration which is the ſecond Creation, the Salvation of men: and their Election took its Original from the Law which was given to <hi>Adam;</hi> and from that death which from the tranſgreſſion of that
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:62635:39"/>Law did ariſe. I ſay, from the death of Chriſt, which is an abolition of the firſt Creation, and which from <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf entred into force. But of this more exactly another time.</p>
                  <p>But by the ſame myſtery, that the Original of Election flowed from <hi>Adam</hi> upon all Men, it was propagated by the ſame <hi>Adam,</hi> as from his Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring, upon his Sons and Grand-children, all the branches of the Jews. For, for that cauſe did God chuſe the ſeed of the Jews, becauſe he was before joyned to their Fathers, in the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned 10 Chap. of <hi>Deuteronomy;</hi> or, which is the ſame, becauſe God choſe the Father of the Jews. For that Glew, by which God clave unto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Jews, was their Election: for it is written in <hi>Exodus, The God of</hi> Abraham, <hi>the God of</hi> Iſaac, <hi>the God of</hi> Jacob. <hi>This is my Name for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and this my memorial from generation to genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Yet take notice of what <hi>Laban</hi> ſayes to <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> Geneſis 31. <hi>The God of</hi> Abraham, <hi>the God of</hi> Nachar, <hi>judge betwixt us, and the God of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi> Where obſerve, that God was not onely the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but the God of <hi>Nachar, Abraham</hi>'s Brother, and the God of <hi>Thare, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> and <hi>Nachar</hi>'s Father. Therefore the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of the Jews muſt be brought back to <hi>Adam,</hi> the firſt Father and the firſt head of the Jews. And although the Jews are properly ſaid to be the poſterity of <hi>Judah, Jacob</hi>'s fourth Son, yet taking the denomination largely, we ſhall call thoſe Jews likewiſe who were begotten even from <hi>Adam</hi> unto <hi>Judah.</hi> Therefore God elected the Jews, the Poſterity of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
                     <pb n="58" facs="tcp:62635:40"/>becauſe he was joynd to their Fathers <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Abraham;</hi> that is, becauſe he formed the Jews in <hi>Adam,</hi> and bleſſed them in <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The promiſes of this myſtical Election are found from <hi>Adam</hi> unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> both before and after the Flood, repeated often and many wayes to the Fathers of the Jews; but confirmed more peculiarly to the Jews, in <hi>Moſes</hi> by a Covenant, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 7. Where <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaking to the people of the Jews ſayes, <hi>The Lord thy God hath choſen thee to be a peculiar people to himſelf, of all the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that are upon Earth.</hi> God himſelf called that Nation his Firſt-born, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4. <hi>Iſrael, my first-born,</hi> as alſo, <hi>the firſt fruits of the Harveſt of the Lord,</hi> Jeremiah Chap. 2. Both upon the ſame account, by w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> all the firſt-born and firſt fruits belong to God by property of Election, as alſo becauſe the Jews firſt of all received the myſtery &amp; grace of electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. In w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> ſenſe, I ſay, is to be underſtood, Ch. 49. <hi>The Lord from the wombe hath called me:</hi> as alſo, the Kingly Prophet, Pſalm 22. <hi>Thou art he that took me from the wombe, thou art my hope from my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers brests. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon thee was I caſt from my mothers wombe. From the wombe of my mother thou art my God.</hi> God called and choſe <hi>Iſrael</hi> from the wombe of myſtical Election; that is to ſay, the Jews were his firſt-born natural Children by my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Election; nor did he think that they were to be eſteemed as the Gentiles, who were not called from the wombe, nor choſen, nor eſteemed, as his natural Children, but adopted into this myſtical Election, by a ſecond Election, and only eſteemed the Sons of adoption. Hence it is that
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:62635:40"/>the Apoſtle, <hi>Romans</hi> 2. aſcribes firſt, <hi>Salvation, honour, and glory</hi> (which is Election) <hi>to the Jews first, then to the Greeks,</hi> who are the Gentiles; for the Greek in that place is the finer Gentile.</p>
                  <p>That the Jews had the firſt Election, not of their own deſert, but of the meer grace and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God, from hence is apparent; becauſe that myſtical Election proceeded from that eternal E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, by which the Jews were choſen from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity; that is, by which they were choſen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were born, when they had done neither good nor harm. <hi>Not for their works,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, but of the meer bounty of God, who call'd and choſe them. This eternal Election <hi>Iſaiah</hi> meant, Chapt. 63. <hi>Thou</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>Lord art our Father,</hi> Abraham <hi>knew us not, and</hi> Iſrael <hi>had no knowledge of us.</hi> The Prophet means, That God was the Father of the Jews, when their Fathers were not born, at which time <hi>Abraham</hi> knew not the Jews, and <hi>Iſrael</hi> had no knowledge of them, <hi>The Lord did chuſe thee, becauſe he lov'd thee; Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> are here indifferently taken, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7. <hi>Not for their righteouſneſs,</hi> he choſe them. To which adde that place of 9 <hi>Deut. He ſav'd me, becauſe he lov'd me.</hi> Pſal. 18. <hi>He hath made us, and not we our ſelves,</hi> ſung <hi>David,</hi> King of the Jews, Pſalm 100.</p>
                  <p>If you look upon the matter whereof the Jews were created, you will find nothing that ſhall make them appear worthy of the Election; For they were made up of the ſame fleſh and bloud as the Gentiles, and were temper'd with the ſame clay of which other men were fram'd; <hi>As is the clay in the hand of the Potter: ſo art thou, O houſe of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:62635:41"/>Iſrael, in the hand of the Lord.</hi> The Prophet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded to that very clay of which <hi>Adam</hi> the firſt Father of the Jews was made. That ſame <hi>common and impure</hi> clay, which is obſervable. This we are taught, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. In which God is ſaid to <hi>have caſt Adam out of the Paradiſe of pleaſure,</hi> which was moſt choice Land, <hi>that he might till the ground of which he was made.</hi> Ground not choice, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, unclean, of which <hi>Adam</hi> and all other men were made; for common, and not elect, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, are the ſame, <hi>Act.</hi> 10. and many other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of both Teſtaments. And for the ſame cauſe for which <hi>Adam</hi> was made of common and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure clay, God is ſaid to have found <hi>Iſrael, in a place of horror, and waſt wilderneſs,</hi> Deuteronom. 32.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ezekiel</hi> likewiſe bears witneſſe that the Jews were born unclean, as other men were born un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, <hi>Chapter</hi> 16. Where God ſpeaks to the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> his Spouſe, and the Jews, in theſe words, <hi>Thy root and thy linage was from the land of</hi> Canaan, <hi>thy Father was an</hi> Amorrhite, <hi>and thy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a</hi> Hittite; <hi>And when thou waſt born, thy navel was not cut, and thou waſt not waſh'd with water to ſalvation, nor ſalted with ſalt, nor wrapp'd up in clouts. No eye ſpar'd thee, to do any of theſe things for thee: but thou waſt thrown out upon the face of the earth, in the affliction of thy ſoul, in that day wherein thou waſt born. Paſſing by thee, I ſaw thee trampled in thy bloud.</hi> And a little after. <hi>I ſpread my garment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee, and cover'd thy ſhame; And I ſwore to thee, and enter'd into a Covenant with thee, ſaith the Lord, and thou wert made mine, and I waſh'd thee with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and clens'd thee from thy bloud, and anointed thee
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:62635:41"/>with oyl.</hi> By which famous Text it appears, that the Jews ſprung from the ſame root, and were made of the ſame common earth as all the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles were made of. For the <hi>Amorrhites</hi> and the <hi>Hittites</hi> here are taken for any manner of Gentiles; as likewiſe the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> for a Land not yet choſen, an earth common and unclean: I ſay God meant, that the Jews being born of a Father and Mother, ſprung from an unelected earth, were likewiſe themſelves born unelected: that they were born unclean, and defil'd with the bloud of their firſt creation, naked and caſt out: but by the bounty of God, paſſing by them, and pitying them, they were waſh'd, cloath'd, and receiv'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Covenant of myſtical Election.</p>
                  <p>By no better ſignification could the love of God to the Jews have been expreſſed, or rather that holy love by which God in his myſtical ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction was joyn'd to the Jews, than by that my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Marriage, in which God is ſaid to have ſpred his garment over his Spouſe, the people of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Nor is there any other more holy, or near knot, than that, by which two Lovers in the cement of Matrimony make ſuch a mixture of their ſouls, that two become one. Hence theſe ſweet Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues of Lovers, as it were equally match'd, with which <hi>Solomon</hi> has beſprinkled his book of Loves, where God the Bridegroom, lover-like, ſpeaks to his Bride, the people of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And where <hi>Iſrael</hi> his Spouſe, likewiſe enflam'd with love, ſpeaks to God her Husband with reverence and love. Hence thoſe myſtical ornaments and gifts, with which God decks his <hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi>
                     <pb n="62" facs="tcp:62635:42"/>Bride, that he might advance her from the clay of her creation, to the ſplendour of divine glory, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zechiel,</hi> Chap. 16, <hi>I cloth'd thee,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>with partie-coloured garments, and ſhod thee with ſhoes of violet colour, and girded thee with ſilk, and put a fine garment upon thee, and deck'd thee with an ornament: and put bracelets upon thine arms, and a chain about thy neck. And put a jewel upon thy face, and rings into thine ears, and a crown of comlineſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thy head, and thou waſt adorn'd with gold and ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and thou waſt cloth'd with ſilk, and embroydery, of divers colours. Thou didſt eat wheat and honey, and thou becameſt excellently fair, and roſe up into a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, God reſtified his paternal love to the Jews, when he choſe them to be his Sons, and did become their Father, nay, he grac'd his Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of them, when he call'd them his honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sons. <hi>Ephraim is my honourable ſon,</hi> Jerem. 31. Whom he likewiſe nam'd Gods, according to his own name. <hi>O Iſrael, I have call'd thee by my name,</hi> Iſai. 43. According to that ſolemn cuſtom by which children are called after the name of their Father. Of which ſee the 82 Pſalm, <hi>I have ſaid ye are Gods, and all of you ſons of the moſt High.</hi> Which Chriſt himſelf interprets concerning the Jews, in the tenth Chapter of the Goſpel according to St. <hi>John.</hi> The Jews were there ſtoning Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he call'd himſelf a God; Chriſt reproving the Jews in that place, argues with them in theſe words, <hi>Is it not written in your Law, I ſaid you are Gods; If God ſaid that they were Gods to whom the word of God came, the Scripture cannot be falſe. He
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:62635:42"/>whom the Father hath ſanctified, and ſent into the world, you ſay that he blaſphemes, becauſe I ſay I am the ſon of God.</hi> Which you may more more eaſily and roundly poliſh thus, If the Scripture, O Jews call'd you Gods, to whom the word of the Lord came, Why ſhould not I be call'd the Son of God, who am the Word of God? To this, that which is written in the beginning of the ſame Pſalm, <hi>God ſtood in the Congregation of Gods,</hi> and ſtanding in the midſt of the Gods he gives Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which are to be underſtood of the Jews: For that aſſembly, in the midſt of which God is ſaid here to ſtand, was the Temple of God, <hi>That place of the Throne of God, and the place of his fooo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtool, where he dwelt in the midſt of the ſons of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> Ezechiel 43. In which Temple the Aſſembly and Church of the Jews was kept. The Jews then were Gods, and the Aſſembly of Gods was the Synagogue of the Jews, Moreover, God threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in this Pſalm, thoſe Gods and thoſe Jews, that they ſhould die like men; that is to ſay, like the Gentiles, <hi>But you ſhall die like men;</hi> that is, like the Gentiles, as afterwards ſhall appear. <hi>David</hi> tells us the reaſon in the beginning of this Pſalm, why the Jews muſt needs dye as well as the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, <hi>becauſe the Jews,</hi> ſays he, <hi>would judge unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and accept the face of a ſinner;</hi> that is to ſay, becauſe the Jews, forgetting the Law of God, would imitate the iniquity of the Gentiles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would turn themſelves to the faces of the Gentiles, and transform themſelves from ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Jews, to be ſinfull Gentiles; for the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles were ſinners, as after ſhall appear. The Jews
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:62635:43"/>are called gods here, inaſmuch as they are the Sons of God; and becauſe Sons are ſaid not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to bear the names of their Parents, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to repreſent their perſons, <hi>I ſay you are gods, and all of you the ſons of the moſt high.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Jews were Gods moſt dear and beſt belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Children, whom God is ſaid <hi>to carry, as a man is ſaid to carry his child,</hi> Deut. 1. As alſo, <hi>to inſtruct them, as a man inſtructs his ſon,</hi> Deut. 8. <hi>To have carried them about, and to have preſerv'd them as the apple of his eye,</hi> Deut. 32. Which in Latin is tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated, <hi>to have carried them about in his eys.</hi> Nor did God only love them as a Father loves his children, but open'd likewiſe the bowels of his mercy to the Jews, like tender Mothers, who hugg their children cloſe to their breſts. Whom he is likewiſe ſaid <hi>to have carried in his womb; And if the Mother would be unmindfull of her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, yet God would not be unmindful of the Jews;</hi> I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay 49. What ſhall I ſay more of that frienſhip, wherein God was pleaſed to joyn himſelf to the Jews? <hi>God was joyn'd to the Jews, and lov'd them.</hi> Deut. 10. <hi>The ſeed of</hi> Abraham <hi>my friend,</hi> Iſay 4. As alſo God calls Iſrael <hi>his darling, his child of his houſhold, his tender child,</hi> Jeremy 3. Which that I may more nakedly and truly expound, God was tyed to <hi>Iſrael</hi> in that bond of friendſhip, by which <hi>the ſoul of</hi> Jonathan <hi>was tied to the ſoul of</hi> David, 1 Sam. ch. 18. and by ſuch a one as God himſelf lov'd his belov'd Diſciple. Therefore was <hi>Iſrael</hi> call'd, <hi>the chiefeſt lover of the Lord,</hi> Deutero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom. 32.</p>
                  <p>God is alſo call'd the Shepherd of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:62635:43"/>the Jews are call'd the Sheep of his Paſture: <hi>We are the people of the Lords paſture, and the ſheep of his hands,</hi> Pſalm 95. Which was certainly a great ſign of their Election: For a good ſhepherd knows the number of his ſheep, and calls them by their names: So God knows the elect, and reckons their number: <hi>ſo God led the Jews with his rod and his staff, and put them in a place of pasture, &amp; brought them out by the waters of comfort,</hi> Pſalm 23. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, there is no example of love, paternal affection, motherly dearneſſe, friendſhip and care; by which he choſe, lov'd, fed, cared for, and kept the Jews.</p>

                  <p>But firſt of all, the Lord call'd the Jews unto holineſſe, that he might be ſanctified by thoſe that were holy. <hi>Be ye holy, as I am holy.

                  <p>For that cauſe alſo was God ſo intimate with the Jews, that he entruſted them with his laws and decrees, that they were admitted to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of God, that they were called <hi>a wiſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding people.</hi> Deut. 4. <hi>Nor was there any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nation ſo honourable, which had thoſe Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, just Judgements, and the whole Law.</hi> In the ſame Chapter: <hi>What is all fleſh that it ſhould hear the voice of the living God, which ſpeaks out of the fire, and can live,</hi> cries out <hi>Moſes,</hi> Deut. 5. where ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the prerogative of the choſen Jews, and of the ſecond creation of men, which is not granted unto fleſh, that is to ſay, to the firſt creation; for fleſh &amp; the firſt creation conſumes at the hearing and ſight of God, here the ſame <hi>Moſes,</hi> in the ſame Ch. <hi>Behold the Lord our God ſhews unto us his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty

                  <p>Hence it is that they were the chief and choice in Gods eſteem, that the Jews were called <hi>a Nation drawing near unto God,</hi> that they were ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>a great Nation, nor that there was any other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo great, which had Gods drawing near to it.</hi> Ch. 4.

And that was the matter that God appointed the Jews to be the head, and not the rail of the Nations.</p>
                  <p>Nor did God only chuſe the Jews for a time ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the diſtiny of empires and people, but God did chuſe his people for ever. <hi>Thou haſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed

And many things to that ſenſe we read in the Prophets, which I muſt handle another time, and which was a ſpecial token of their election. The Lord would not have the Jews defil'd by? mixture of Nations, <hi>but ſet them apart for an inheritance out of all the Nations of the earth,</hi> 1 Kings Chap. 8. <hi>I have ſet you aſide from all people, that you might be mine,</hi> Lev. 20. Hence it is that God is ſaid to have hedg'd, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clos'd, and as it were with a wall of fence, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded <hi>Iſrael</hi> his poſſeſſion, his land, his vine.

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:62635:48"/>ſhall have occaſion to ſet forth more at large.</p>
                  <p>That the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> which the Jews inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited, was that choice bleſſed earth, and belov'd of the Lord, is ſet down in the 8. of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> where <hi>Moſes</hi> call'd it, <hi>A Land of rivers, waters, and fountains: in the fields of which, ſhould break out pools of water.

                  <p>The Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> was likewiſe call'd <hi>The Land of Promiſe:</hi> becauſe God by a peculiar Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant

                  <q>Where by the famous <hi>Nile</hi> the ſea is changed.</q>
                  <p>The deſert is ſtretched from the border of the ſea of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> &amp; continued along by the border of the gulf of <hi>Arabia,</hi> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> by a name largely taken the Hebrews call <hi>the flood of Egypt,</hi> where it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorges it ſelf into the Red Sea, and that is it which is meant in <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. <hi>I will put the bounds from the deſart to the River.</hi> That is to ſay, from the Border of the Sea of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> which is <hi>Nile,</hi> and the Border of the gulf of <hi>Arabia,</hi> to <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates,</hi> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is here ſimply called the River. Theſe bounds then were appointed to the Holy Land: the Red Sea, which is the Ocean &amp; the Sea of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtine,</hi> which is the Mediterranean; on one hand, <hi>Nilus;</hi> and <hi>Euphrates</hi> on the other. And here really was that fenced Garden of the Jews: nor could there be one better fenced, then one envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roned with two Seas, and two great Rivers. That you may not onely imagine, but ſee plainly this deſcription, I will here inſert the Map of it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt you muſt take notice, That as the Jews were not choſen according to their own deſert, being made of that common clay, but of the meer grace of God. So the Land of the Jews was good, and choſen not of its own nature, but of the pleaſure of God, who bleſſed and choſe it,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:62635:50"/>which <hi>Moſes</hi> tells us in <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> 11. <hi>That Land,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>is not like the Land of Egypt, where after the ſeed is ſown, they dig rivers to water it, but it is of hills and fields, expecting rain from heaven to water it, which thy God viſits alwayes, and his eyes are upon it from the beginning of the yeer to the end of it.</hi> Therefore that ground was fertile not of its own nature and diſpoſition, as the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which is accounted of all Nations the fertilleſt upon Earth: but becauſe God had bleſt it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he gave it rain in his own time, and <hi>opened to it his good treaſure,</hi> as it is <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. and Chapter 33. <hi>becauſe the heaven mizled with rain upon it:</hi> and that I may end in a word, becauſe God deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed moſt upon it.</p>
                  <p>God <hi>provided</hi> that elect earth <hi>for the elected Jews, Ezech.</hi> 20. <hi>That Iſrael might dwel in it alone, and without fear,</hi> Deut. 33. That is, undefiled with admiration of Nations, which aſcribe to that chief right of election what we handled in the former Chapter, in which God ſet aſide the Jews for a peculiar people and Nation, out of all the peoples and Nations of the earth; whom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing choſen for his portion and the lot of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, he likewiſe placed in a choice Land, that they might inhabite it alone without fear.</p>

                  <p>AFter we have ſpoken of the election of the Jews, it is fit that in order we ſhould ſpeak of the election of the Gentiles, which ſprang from the Jews, as our Lord Jeſus Chriſt himſelf moſt openly expreſſes to the <hi>Samaritan</hi> Woman, in the fourth Chapter of the Goſpel according to St. <hi>John, Salvation is by the Jews.</hi> But that which God the Son told this Gentile woman, God the Father long before promis'd the Fathers of the Jews, <hi>firſt to Abraham,</hi> Geneſis Chapter 12. <hi>All the kinreds of the earth ſhall be bleſſed in thee.</hi> Then in the following Chapter, <hi>That all the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the earth ſhould be bleſſed in</hi> Abraham, The Angel which was the Lord himſelf, did bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Likewiſe this promiſe gave God unto Iſaac, <hi>In thy ſeed ſhall all the Nations of the earth be bleſſed,</hi> Gen. 26. And to Jacob, Chap. 28. <hi>All the nations of the earth ſhall be bleſſed in thee and thy ſeed.</hi> Therefore it appears, that in the Fathers of the Jews, and in their ſeed, and in the Jews them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, all the <hi>Kinreds,</hi> all the <hi>People,</hi> all the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> and <hi>Tribes</hi> of the earth were to be bleſſed, but theſe Kinreds, Nations, People and Tribes, we ſhall meerly call thoſe Gentiles, which are without the Kinred, Nation, People, and Tribe of the Jews.</p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:62635:55"/>
                  <p>That bleſſing by which the Gentiles were bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Jews, is, The election of God in myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: which was firſt proper to the Jewes, and which by derivation and participation was from the Jews powr'd upon the Gentiles. Therefore, if God have preferr'd the Jews in a myſtical ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; let the Gentiles have next place with him in the ſame election. But by no nearer title did the Jews cleave to God, than by this; that they were the firſt-born in this myſtical Election. That myſtical begetting of the Jews, was a kind of a myſtical nature, by which the Jews were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged as natural Sons. For which, <hi>God is ſaid to have carried them in his womb,</hi> Iſa. 46. To which portion or degree of nature, becauſe the Gentiles were neither called nor choſen, adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was granted to them, which is an imitation of Nature; by which being adopted into the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of the Jews, they were eſteem'd the Sons of the Jews, not according to fleſh and nature, but according to that adoption which is perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by myſtical nature. I ſay, by that ſame ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, by which the Jews are the Sons of God in the firſt degree of nature, and by which the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles adopted in the Jews, are called the Sons of God: but becauſe they come in by a ſecond de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, by adoption, are onely call'd and eſteem'd adoptive Sons. In which ſenſe St. <hi>Paul</hi> is to be underſtood, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. where he ſays, <hi>That God did pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The Gentiles were adopted into the family of the Jews by that myſtical election; at which

For he can raiſe up ſtones, who can <hi>call things that are not, as if they were;</hi> as to this purpo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpoke, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. That is to ſay, who can call men out of ſtones, and turn the ſtones themſelves to be men: ſtones, I ſay, that are diſtant from men in the whole ſcheme of animals: I ſay, God, that could doe theſe things, which are without and beyond nature, could likewiſe adopt Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to <hi>Abraham,</hi> which is an imitation of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>Adoption, ſayes he, is an holy thing, which imitates the benefit of nature: But by how much truth is more holy than Imitation, by ſo much is nature more holy than adoption. Nature and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption make ſons, nature true ones, adoption feign'd ones. Adoption transfers men from one Family to another, and from one name to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. It changes the kinred, which is fiction and imitation; but cannot change the bloud, which belongs to nature and truth. But neither can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:62635:56"/>alter the condition of the linage. As for example, it can make ſons, but of libertines cannot make free, or of ſervants freemen. The myſtical adoption is otherwiſe, by the force of which, the nature of the Gentiles is turn'd into the nature of the Jews. That which is imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of nature in civil adoption, is nature it ſelf in the myſtical: And truth, whoſe image is preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded only by the Law, is by the myſtery of this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption really begotten. Therefore the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles change both their kind and their linage by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption, and tranſlation into the Nation and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of the Jews. And becauſe they change their ſtock, they change likewiſe the condition of their ſtock; for the Gentiles become by that adoption not only ſons, but of ſervants free-men, and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born. For all the efficacie of this adoption, is to liberty: and all ſuch who by right of that adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion come to a part of the liberty of the ſons of God, claim a liberty.</p>
                  <p>That myſtery, is the force and power of the Spirit of Chriſt, by which the Gentiles are chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into ſpiritual Jews, and into the true ſons of <hi>Abraham,</hi> not according to the nature of the fleſh, but according to the nature of Promiſe and Spirit, which is the true adoption and election of the Gentiles. Yea, Promiſe is that election, by which alone the Jews are what they are; by which the Jews themſelves are the ſons of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> true Iſraelites, and true Jews, not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the fleſh, but according to Promiſe and to Spirit. <hi>For all thoſe that deſcended of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>are not</hi> Iſraelites, <hi>nor thoſe who are the feed of</hi> Abraham
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:62635:56"/>
                     <hi>all his ſons: but in</hi> Iſaac <hi>ſhall thy ſeed be call'd; that is to ſay, not the ſons of the fleſh, or the Jews, but thoſe that are called ſons of the Promiſe in his ſeed,</hi> Rom. 9. I ſay, that promiſe is it which makes true Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites, and true ſons of God. But alſo the Jews without that ſhall loſe their own family, which is Gods, and their father <hi>Abraham,</hi> they would leave off to be what they are, and of Jews become Gentiles, and by croſſe-changing of their kinred, of ſons of God become ſons of men.</p>
                  <p>The Scripture more ſignificantly expreſſes this converſion of the kinred of the Gentiles, into the kinred of the Jews, where it affirms them not only to be adopted, but ingrafted in the Jews: That as a branch which is grafted grows to be one with the tree wherein it is grafted, whether it be grafted by plaſtring, or inciſion. I ſay, as by inciſion one tree is chang'd into another, and of two ariſes one: ſo the Gentiles by ingrafting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come one with the Jews: as alſo by force of that ingrafting are chang'd to be the very Jews, and ſo from two Nations are made one people of God.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, there is a difference betwixt grafting of one tree into another, and grafting of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles into the Jews; for an unfertil tree uſes not to be grafted in an unfertile one, nor a wild one on a kindly and right ſtock; but the branches of the Gentiles, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="88" facs="tcp:62635:57"/>hath taught us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. where he compared the Gentiles to a wilde Olive, but the Iew, in which the Gentile is engrafted, to a good and right Olive. Likewiſe Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in that place made that wild Olive partaker of that juice and fatneſs which is in the true Olive. Therefore the Gentile be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſanctified, or this wilde Olive turn'd into a a true Olive, may well wonder at the new fruits of his works, his new ſap, which is none of his own.</p>

                  <p>WE ſhall prove the Gentiles different in their Original from the Jews, both by their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption, and by their engrafting in the Jews: for adoption concerns ſtrange Families; and trees of ſeveral kindes are grafted one in another. Nor am I ignorant, that Kinred by the Female ſide, and Coſens might be adopted for Sons: but we muſt obſerve, that Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> Epheſ. 2. ſet down the Gentiles that were received into the Family of the Jews, <hi>ſtrangers, aliens, unknown, far diſtant</hi> from the Family of the Jews; which in that place the Apoſtle calls a Commonwealth; and in regard of that, calls the Gentiles their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Citizens
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:62635:57"/>with the Saints, that is to ſay, of the Jews. But this Commonwealth, ſo to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, as that the Jews and the Gentiles are both the Domeſticks and Sons of God.</p>
                  <p>I know likewiſe, that in Trees of the ſame kind ſweet are grafted in ſweet, and true ſtocks in true ones: but you muſt take notice, that in <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> has a two-fold grafting, according to Nature, and againſt Nature. The Apoſtle has given us in that place one example of grafting, <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to nature,</hi> when he ſets down that by which he tells us, the Jews ſhall ſometimes be again grafted in their own Olive. Again, he has given us an inſtance of grafting againſt Nature, which the Gentiles are grafted in the Jews: <hi>That againſt Nature,</hi> he calls this, when the Gentiles, diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in original from the Jews, againſt the Nature of their ſtock, were grafted the wilde ſtock in the tame one. Nature then, which is the Original and Linage of the Gentiles, is different and not the ſame with the Original and Linage of the Jews.</p>
                  <p>And by no more diſtinguiſhing &amp; congruous dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference could the Gentiles have been noted diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in ſtock and Original from the Jews, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Yea, you will ſay, If adoption admits onely, in imitation of Nature, the younger into the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the elder, according as Sons ought to be younger than their Fathers. What Monſter of adoption is that, by which, the Jews being youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger adopted the moſt ancient Gentiles to be their Sons. And again, if in regard of the ſame age, a Tree is ſaid to adopt a graft: I ſay, if a tender and new plant is grafted in an old and ſtrong ſtock, what new manner of grafting is that, by which the moſt ancient Gentiles ſhall be grafted in the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Jews? and if you look upon the original, quite green. I anſwer, That the Gentiles in their Creation and Nature are indeed ancienter then the Jews: but the Gentiles are ſaid to be adopted into the Jews by that myſtical Election, not by Creation and Nature: of which, <hi>Geneſis</hi> gives a fair inſtance, where <hi>Eſau</hi> was elder, but younger in election.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle calls thoſe Gentiles, who accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my ſuppoſition were the men of the firſt Creation, <hi>Atheists,</hi> or <hi>without a God,</hi> in reſpect to that oppoſition by which that true God the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of Heaven and Earth: was not the God of the Gentiles, as he was God of the Jews; and, as the Gentiles did not enjoy him for their God, as did the Jews. And that was for this reaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God had diſcovered himſelf to the Nation of the Jews, and to them alone, but not ſo to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations: wherefore the Jews are called <hi>The people of God.</hi> Hence it is that God ſpeaks to them friendly, <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 34. <hi>You are my flock, you are the flock of my paſture, you are my men.</hi>

                  <head type="sub">That the Gentiles are called Sinners.</head>
                  <p>IT is likewiſe common in both the Teſtaments, that the Gentiles are are call'd <hi>Sinners,</hi> by way of oppoſition, as the Jews are call'd holy and juſt. This was Gods intention, that the Jews might be turn'd away from the fellowſhip and cuſtoms of the Gentiles. Therfore <hi>David</hi> calls him <hi>Bleſſed, which had not gone into the councel of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, and had not ſtood in the way of ſinners; but whoſe will was in the Law of the Lord.</hi> That is to ſay, he thought that Jew bleſſed, who had not betaken himſelf to the Gentiles; but had ſtood cloſe in his eſtate of Jewiſh election and ſanctity; who was a Jew, not according to the fleſh, but according to the Spirit, and was conſtant in the meditation of Gods Law. For a Jew in this place, is he who is addicted to Gods Precepts. Gentiles called thoſe who were wicked and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners every where in the ſame Kingly Prophet, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 37. <hi>The ſinner watches the juſt man.</hi> And a little after; <hi>The ſinner watches the juſt man, and ſeeks to put him to death;</hi> That is to ſay, the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile lies in wait for the Jew. For the ſinner is the Gentile, and the juſt man is the Jew; yea, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand this whole Pſalm of the Jews and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles; for there is a perpetual oppoſition
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:62635:60"/>betwixt the Jews and the Gentiles.</p>
                  <p>There is a remarkable place in the 85 Pſalm, of that mix'd cup, which God in revenge of the Jews, ſhall give at the end of time to the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to drink, and which the <hi>Revelation</hi> ſpeaks of, Chap. 14, &amp; 18. <hi>All the ſinners of the earth,</hi> ſays the Pſalmiſt, <hi>ſhal drink the dreggs of it.</hi> Which in its own place I ſhall ſhow to be underſtood of the Gentile, and in moſt places of the holy Scripture. The Pſalm 109. is likewiſe ſung of the laſt reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and curſe of the people of the Jews: where you ſhall read among other things, <hi>Appoint thou a ſinner over him;</hi> that is, put the Gentile over the Jew, and let the Jew be the tayl, who was before the head.</p>
                  <p>The New Teſtament hath more expreſly taken notice of the Gentiles for ſinners; eſpecially St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in the ſecond to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> where he ſays concerning himſelf and Saint <hi>Peter, We,</hi> ſays he, <hi>by nature are Jews, and not ſinners of the Gentiles,</hi> which were by nature and original Jews, not Gentiles. To this adde what our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſays, <hi>Luke</hi> 6. ſpeaking to the Iews, <hi>If you do well by them which do ſo by you, what thanks have you? for ſinners doe that likewiſe.</hi> Sinners in that place are Gentiles; for it belongeth to a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, and to humane nature, to do good to ſuch, as doe good to them. Yea, it is common to all other creatures to return a like for a like, which is a natural retaliation. <hi>The Ox knoweth his ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and the Aſs his maſters crib,</hi> Iſaiah 1. It is a natural thing therefore to return thanks, and one good thing for another; but it is a ſupernatural
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:62635:61"/>bleſſing to return a good deed for a bad. And God to this ſupernaturality invites his Jews. To theſe adde, that which follows in the ſame Saint <hi>Luke</hi> in the ſame Chapter, <hi>If you lend to thoſe from whom you hope to receive, what thanks have you? for ſinners lend to ſinners, that they may receive alike: but love you your enemies.</hi> Which is the ſame, as if the Lord had ſaid, The Gentiles lend to their Friends for uſury and benefit: but O you Jews, my men, do not lend upon uſe to the Gentiles: but lend them freely, and without uſe and hope of gain. Yea, let all thy things be common to him, as to thy Friend, which is your duty, as being holy and elected in the Lord, and to whom it were baſe and ſhameful to emulate the deeds of the Gentiles, who were neither e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, nor holy.</p>
                  <p>The Jews thought Chriſt a Gentile, not a Jew, becauſe he had healed a blinde man on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, in the Goſpel of Saint <hi>John,</hi> Chap. 9. <hi>This man,</hi> ſay they, <hi>is not from God, who regards not the Sabbath, but a ſinner.</hi> Which is as much as if he had ſaid, This man is not a Jew but a Gentile: for the man from God or of God, as we ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is the Jew; the ſinner, the Gentile. It is likewiſe known, the Jews were wont to reckon Chriſt amongſt Eaters and gluttons of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, becauſe he was a Friend of <hi>Publicans and ſinners,</hi> and becauſe he came into their houſes and ſat with them, as alſo, becauſe he received Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans and ſinners. Both with the Jews are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, either to enter into the Gentiles, or to receive them. Publicans and ſinners are put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:62635:61"/>in many places of the Goſpel, becauſe the Publicans or Farmers of the Cuſtomes, which the Jews paid to the Romans, were Gentiles or ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners amongſt the Gentiles.</p>
                  <p>We muſt likewiſe conſider the anſwer which our Saviour gave to the Jews when they enquired of his Diſciples, why he ſat and did eat with pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans and ſinners: <hi>I came not,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>to call the juſt, but ſinners to repentance:</hi> which is, I came not to call the Jews, but Gentiles to repentance. For Chriſt did propheſie there ſhould be a call of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and Gentiles, of all ſuch as would hear his voice, and a rejection of the ſinners and Gentiles of all ſuch which would not hear his voice. Like to this is that <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. <hi>The Son of man ſhall be betrayed into the hands of ſinners:</hi> for the Son of man was betrayed into the hands of men, or ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, or Gentiles, which is the ſame; that by the Romans, who were Gentiles, and not by the Jews, he might be condemned and cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
                  <p>Moreover by this obſervation of ſins we excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently finde the meaning of that place to the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lathians,</hi> Chap. 2. where you ſhall read this, <hi>But if deſiring to be juſtified in Chriſt, we be found ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, is God the Author of ſin,</hi> &amp;c? Which you muſt thus open and underſtand, But if we Jews deſiring to be juſtified in Chriſt: for here he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of the Jews who would not live after the manner of the Gentiles. If we Jews, ſayes he, deſiring to be juſtified in Chriſt, the God of the Gentiles, are found to be Gentiles, that is, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate into ſinful Gentiles, ſhall Chriſt be the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:62635:62"/>cauſe that we, contrary to the Command of God, have departed from being Jews to be Gentiles, that leaving the Law of God, we have turn'd to the Councel of the ungodly, and walked in the way of ſinners? God forbid, ſayes the Apoſtle, that we ſhould think any ſuch thing. For Chriſt is not the cauſe of the Gentiles ſins, but of Faith. which Gentiles, who believe in Chriſt, have in Chriſt. Chriſt deſtroyes the ſins of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles; but is the Author of Faith to the Gentiles, and wakens that Faith which he revealed to the Nations, of ſinners, then in name; but elected through Faith, and called to the holineſs of the Jews. What then, if we be called Gentiles ſo long as the Faith of the Gentiles, is inherent in us; and we are juſtified by Chriſt the God of the Gentiles.</p>

                  <p>VVE muſt very attentively obſerve that which we read in the 9 of the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> where Chriſt, the wiſdom of the Father, ſpeaks to the Gentiles, whom being made a man, he was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to call, in theſe words, <hi>My ſpeech unto the ſons of men, Understand, ye little ones wiſdom, and ye fooliſh take heed.</hi> Wiſdom cried out, ſtanding in the ſtreets and high-wayes, ſpeaking to the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial, commune, and unclean Gentiles, and who are here openly meant, by <hi>the ſons of men,</hi> and by
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:62635:62"/>the <hi>unwiſe,</hi> and likewiſe here called <hi>lutle ones.</hi> That voice which was heard from Heaven, which ſtirs up both Jews and Gentiles, gathered into one Church, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. <hi>Give praiſe to God you his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants that fear him ſmall and great,</hi> did mean theſe ſame little ones, that is, praiſe the Lord both Jews and Gentiles, as you were of old incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and unanimous, or as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> tranſlates and reherſes it, <hi>Romans</hi> 15. <hi>Rejoyce ye Nations with his people.</hi> But of the agreement of the Jews and Gentiles in praiſing of God, we ſhall ſpeak more in its due place.</p>
                  <p>It is clear, that the Gentiles are called little ones, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 64. <hi>The arrows of the little ones are made their wounds;</hi> that is, the Gentiles are woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the ſame Arrows which they ſhot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Jews, according to the 35 <hi>Pſalm. The ſnare which the Gentiles have laid for the Jews, hath taken them, and they are fallen into the ſame ſnare.</hi> Wiſdom cries out, Chap. 1. <hi>Ye little ones how long will ye love childiſhneſs, and ye fools thoſe things that are hurtful to you, and fools hate underſtanding?</hi> The little ones, fools, and unwiſe, in that place are the Gentiles, who ſtammer like Infants, who deſire things hurtful to them, and hate the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which is of God. <hi>Solomon</hi> calls thoſe ſame little ones, evil and wicked men, Chap. 7. of the ſame Book, where he ſayes thus, <hi>I looked out of my window through the caſement, and I ſee the little ones; I obſerve the fooliſh young man, who walks in the ſtreet by the corner, walking in the dark when it's almoſt night.</hi> Underſtand thoſe little ones here, not ſuch are borderers upon Infancy, but thoſe

                  <p>The Gentiles are call'd little ones, in regard of the Jews, who are call'd the <hi>great Nation, nor was there another Nation ſo great,</hi> Deut. 4. <hi>And higher then other Nations,</hi> Deut. 26.

Therefore the Jews were great, in that they were choſen, and belov'd by God, and becauſe in that regard they excell'd all other Peoples and Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe word; in the 18 Chapter of <hi>Lukes</hi> goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, are likewiſe to be taken figuratively, <hi>Let the children come unto me, and forbid them not; for of ſuch is the Kingdom of heaven.</hi> Which is, ſuffer the Gentiles to come unto me; for they ſhall hear my voice, and believe in my name. But the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven belongs to <hi>ſuch,</hi> who ſhall hear me, and believe me. Certainly, the ſimplicity of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants and children, which was that likewiſe of the firſt creation, is not that alone by which we enter into the kingdom of heaven, by which comes Election and Salvation; but the grace of the goſpel, which is the faith of the Gentiles in Chriſt. Which that you may more clearly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, take heed to that which follows, <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever,</hi> ſays Chriſt, <hi>receives not the kingdom of Chriſt as a little Child, ſhall not enter into it.</hi> Which thus interpret and explain, Whoſoever receives not the doctrine of the goſpel as a little child; that is to ſay, like a Gentile, who believe me, and humbly relies upon my grace, not as a Jew, who believes <hi>Moſes,</hi> and is gloriouſly addicted to the works of the Law, he ſhall not be partner of the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and glory which is in the kingdom of God.</p>
                  <p>The diſciples of Chriſt were ſtriving, and the Jews themſelves, who ſhould be the greateſt in the kingdom of heaven, Matth. 18. <hi>And Jeſus
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:62635:64"/>calling a little one, plac'd him in the midst of them, and ſaid, Verily I ſay unto you, unleſs you be convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and made like little ones, you ſhall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. Whoſoever therefore ſhall humble himſelf, as this little one doth, he ſhall be the greateſt in the kingdom of heaven.</hi> The words and the actions of our Saviour, certainly, were for the moſt part Parables; Therefore he ſpake here fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratively and parabollically to the Jews, ſwell'd with vain-glory, becauſe they were call'd great, and a great Nation, unleſſe their ſtomachs fell, and they were turn'd to little ones, as the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, they ſhould not have entrance into the kingdom of heaven. Here God apparently meant the Gentiles, by thoſe Little ones, becauſe he ſayes after, <hi>Whoever ſhal offend one of theſe little ones who ſhal believe in me, &amp;c.</hi> Which could not be taken of no infants, or children, which were ſo by age, whoſe faith was yet ſtammering, but of the Gentiles of riper age, who believed in Chriſt as men of age and ripe reaſon believe in him; but the Jews uſed to defame the Gentiles, whom they eſteemed vile, humble, and nothing worth.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, it is manifeſt, that the Gentiles were types of Chriſtian humility, which by infants and children is repreſented, and the Jews only bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of vain-glory; from that Parable wherein the Phariſee marches ſo ſtately into the Temple, caſting his merits to God, Luc. 18. <hi>Lord,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>I thank thee, that I am not like other men, extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners, unjuſt, adulterers, or even like this Publican, I faſt twice in the week, I give the tenth of all that

But the Publican ſtanding afar off, would not lift up his eyes to heaven, but ſtruck his bleſt, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, God be merciful to me a ſinner.</hi> The Phariſee, without doubt in that place, was the Jew; for which cauſe he ſaid, <hi>I am not like other men;</hi> that is, like the Gentiles; for th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As alſo thoſe that exacted tribute from the Jews were Gentiles, as we have ſaid. Certainly, the humility of the Gentiles, which was the default of their vileneſſe and reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, became a Chriſtian vertue under the Goſpel. On the contrary, that glory by which the Jews exalted themſelves to be a great Nation before the Goſpel, was turn'd into the ſmoake of idle pride under the Goſpel. And bence it came to paſſe, that the Gentiles, who were truly humble, were exalted to be Jews really great. On the contrary, the glorious Jews became a baſe and an abject people. <hi>I ſay to you,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>The Publican went to his houſe juſtified;</hi> that is to ſay, made a juſt man, or a Jew of a Gentile. The Phariſee, on the contrary, not being heard, left off to be juſt, and to be a Jew, and fell off to be a Gentile. To which apply that of <hi>Matthew,</hi> now cited, Chap. 18. <hi>Who ſhall humble himſelf like a little one</hi> (or a Gentile) <hi>ſhal be greateſt in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven.</hi>

                  <p>IN the Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> call'd the Gentiles, <hi>the ſons of wrath,</hi> and reckoned himſelf amongſt the Gentiles, being the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle of the Gentiles, when he ſayes, <hi>And we by nature are the ſons of wrath,</hi> whether we conceive them to be the ſons of the firſt Creation, whom the Lord abhors, or whether we take them as oppoſite to the Jews, who by the Nature of their Election, are eſteemed <hi>the ſons of love.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Gentiles likewiſe called the Enemies of God, in as much as the firſt Creation, which is Eleſh, is enmity with God; or becauſe the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, by a narural imbred hatred, are Enemies to the Jews: <hi>Let all thy enemies periſh,</hi> did <hi>Deborah</hi> ſing, who had deſtroyed the Gentiles, who were Enemies to the Jews and to God: but concerning the Gentiles, Enemies to God and the Jews, more at large in its due place.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, that which is the chief diſgrace of the Gentiles, is, that they are compared eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where to Beaſts in ſacred Authors; and are accounted Beaſts, beneath men, by reaſon of that great oppoſition, by which the Iews are account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

The 22 <hi>Pſa.</hi> thus complains of the Nations who had aſſaulted <hi>Iſrael, Many Bulls have encompaſſed me, fat Bulls have beſet me, they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened their mouth upon me, like a ravening and a roar-Lion.</hi> (Pſalm 57. <hi>Deliver me from the Lion's whelps, the ſons of men, whoſe teeth are weapons and arrows.</hi> Yea, the 74 Pſalm called the Gentiles <hi>Beaſts, Give not the beasts ſouls that truſt in thee:</hi> that is, Deliver not the Jews who acknowledge thee to be the God of the Iews to the Gentiles their enemies, who neither know thee nor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge thee: to which apply, that of <hi>Baruch</hi> Chap. 3. <hi>Where the Princes of the Nations ſhall have dominion over the beaſts of the earth,</hi> that is, over the Gentiles, their flocks and their people.</p>
                  <p>There is a remarkable place to this purpoſe, in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> Chap. 3. <hi>Thou are made honourable and glorious in my eyes,</hi> ſaid God to the people of the Jews, <hi>I have loved thee, I will give men for thee, and Nations for thy ſoul.</hi> That is, I will expiate and redeem thee by the death of men and people, that is, of the Gentiles, whom like Beaſts I will ſacrifice for thee. There could be no thing granted to the Jews more honourable and glorious than that honour and glory to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come honourable and glorious before the eyes of God. As likewiſe, the Gentiles are numbred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Beaſts and Creatures walking upon the Earth, in the ſame Chap. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 24. <hi>So ſayes the Lord who created the heavens, giving breath to the people upon the earth, and life to them that tread upon it.</hi> The people walking there upon the earth, is indifferently taken for men and beaſts:

                  <p>The Jews did not value men by their reaſon, but by their underſtanding: I ſay, by that intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect by which the true knowledg of God is gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which is above reaſon; by which the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of the Divine Law was given to the Jews, and by which the granting of the Spirit of Chriſt was revealed to the Jews.

In which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, <hi>Abraham,</hi> by the right of the Promiſes, is fitly call'd the firſt Father of the Jews.

Wherefore God was call'd the <hi>faſhioner of the Jews,</hi> Iſa. 45. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, the holy one of Iſrael, the faſhioner of him.</hi> God was
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:62635:69"/>the faſhioner of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> becauſe he was the faſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the firſt Father of them, whom he made of the clay of the earth. Wherefore God is ſaid in <hi>Deut.</hi> 26. <hi>To have made the Jews higher than all the Nations he had created.</hi> For God had firſt crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Gentiles, and the men of the firſt creation; then form'd the Jews, the ſons of Promiſe, and the ſecond creation.</p>
                  <p>It is worth our taking notice, that the men of the firſt creation, (who, according to my ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, are Gentiles,) as alſo the whole world, were created <hi>by the word.</hi> The firſt Chapter of <hi>Geneſis</hi> hath this expreſly; which is the Chapter of the creation. <hi>And God ſaid, Let us make man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our own Image.</hi> He ſaid, <hi>Let us make.</hi> And by his word he made him. But not by his word, but of wrought clay, the Lord made <hi>Adam, Gen.</hi> Chap. 2. Which Chapter peculiarly han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles the creation of <hi>Adam,</hi> and the framing of the Jews in <hi>Adam.</hi> Whoſe Hiſtorie <hi>Moſes</hi> being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to write, began it from the duſt of <hi>Adam;</hi> the firſt father of the Jews, as is uſual amongſt all Hiſtoriographers who write the Hiſtorie of their Nation, to begin from the firſt Authors of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And God made</hi> Adam <hi>of the duſt of the earth,</hi> ſaith <hi>Gen:</hi> Chap. 2. He did not create <hi>Adam</hi> by his word, but made him with his hand out of the duſt of the earth. That duſt of which the Lord fram'd <hi>Adam, was as the clay in the hand of the Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> as <hi>Ieremiah</hi> ſpeaks to this purpoſe. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſore you ſhall find it written in the 45 Chapter of <hi>Iſaias,</hi> now mentioned. <hi>Ask the things to come of my ſons, and command me concerning the work of
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:62635:70"/>my hands.</hi> Where the ſons of God, and the work of Gods hands, are clearly the Jews. I know it is written in the ſame <hi>Iſaias, My hand hath laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand hath meaſur'd the heavens.</hi> As alſo Chap. 19. <hi>The Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſrrian is the work of my hands.</hi> But you muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, where you read that the hand of God was us'd in the creation; that phraſe is there u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed according to the force of the Hebrew tongue, for the force and power of God, which is the word of God. And in that regard, the word of God, who is the Son of God, and who is the only force, power, and great ſtrength of God, is not only call'd <hi>the hand of God,</hi> but <hi>the arm of the Lord;</hi> which I muſt in another place more exactly exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. But where the hand of God is aſcrib'd to forming, and as it were to the Potter, they are meerly taken for the hands wherewith he, as a Potter, moulded the clay, and made the work. Therefore, in the ſame ſence as the Lord is called <hi>the faſhioner of the Jews,</hi> Iſa. 54. in the ſame ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification the Jews are truly and properly call'd <hi>the work of the hands of the Lord,</hi> in the ſame place and the ſame Chapter.</p>
                  <p>Certainly <hi>Adam</hi> in the genealogie of Chriſt is call'd the firſt, and the Father of the Jews, where Chriſt is deriv'd from <hi>Adam,</hi> in the third Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the goſpel according to St. <hi>Luke.</hi> Where take good notice, that <hi>Adam</hi> the firſt author, the firſt Father of the linage of the Jews is called <hi>the ſon of God.</hi> For it is ſaid about the end of that Chapter, <hi>Who was the ſon of Enos, who was the ſon of</hi> Seth, <hi>who was the ſon of God.</hi> Adam then was
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:62635:70"/>the ſon of God. By that faſhioning, and for that reaſon, becauſe being made of the duſt of the earth, he was the work of his hands. For which reaſon all the Jews deſcended from <hi>Adam;</hi> that is; the ſons of <hi>Adam,</hi> made by God, and the work of his hands in <hi>Adam,</hi> are calld the ſons of God. But why may I not likewiſe call the Jews the ſons of <hi>Adam,</hi> ſince they are alſo called the ſons of <hi>Jacob,</hi> the ſons of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> the ſons of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham?</hi> I ſay, for the ſame reaſon as <hi>Adam</hi> was the Father of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Jews by name are call'd the ſons of <hi>Adam,</hi> Pſalm 58. <hi>If you truly ſpeak juſtice, and judge right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ye ſons of</hi> Adam, <hi>for ye work wickedneſſe in your heart, and your hands work injustice upon the earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Kingly Prophet in this place reproves the Jews, whom according to the Hebrew text, he calls <hi>the ſons of</hi> Adam, becauſe profeſſing juſtice with their mouths they judg'd wickedneſſe, and in their heart and affections wrought the wickedneſſe of the Gentiles. Which reproach you ſhall often find caſt upon the Jews. Such is that of <hi>Iſay</hi> 49. <hi>This people draw nigh to me with their lip, but their heart is far from me, and they have worſhip'd me according to the command of men and doctrine;</hi> that is, they have worſhip'd me accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the order, commands, and doctrine of the Gentiles. The ſecond reproach caſt upon the the Jews in this Pſalm, is, <hi>That their hands wrought wickedneſſe upon earth.</hi> Which earth is to be underſtood that choice holy earth, and <hi>Land of the Saints,</hi> that is, of the Jews, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:62635:71"/>It was a great crime in the Jews that they had wrought injuſtice, but a greater crime, that they had wrought it in the land of the Lord, which was elect and holy, which <hi>to fill with iniquity,</hi> as <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel</hi> 8 Chap. ſpeaks, was to provoke the Lord. Hence that laid upon the Church of the Iews, <hi>Thou haſt polluted the land with thy fornications and wickedneſſe;</hi> which in another place he call'd <hi>to defile the earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here the Iews are underſtood by the ſons of <hi>Adam,</hi> who ſpake juſtice with their mouthes, but judg'd wickedly and wrought iniquities in their heart, and fram'd injuſtice in the Land ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and elect, which is as much to the Iews, as to live like Gentiles. And <hi>David,</hi> to deterre the ſons of <hi>Adam,</hi> the Iews, from ſuch deeds of the Gentiles, ſhows them what the Gentiles were, and what puniſhment they were to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect for their wickedneſſe in the ſame Pſalm, and in the next words, <hi>They erre,</hi> ſay they, <hi>being ſinners from the womb; they are ſinners from their from their nativity; they have ſpoken falſe things:</hi> which read thus in that place, That he meant, <hi>they were ſinners from the womb,</hi> in the ſame ſenſe as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of the Gentiles, Epheſians 2. <hi>Sons of wrath by nature;</hi> for by nature, is the ſame as from the womb.

                  <p>On the contrary, The Gentiles were called ſtrangers, who did not derive themſelves from God and <hi>Adam:</hi> to which ſtrangers and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, it was not lawful for the Jews to approach, <hi>Act.</hi> 10. <hi>It is abominable to a Jew, to be joynedor draw nigh to a ſtranger,</hi> that is, to a Gentile; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, they were called by the Jews ſtrangers, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, becauſe they were aliens, not onely from the Nation, but family of the Jews, nor were not onely received as brothers into the Holy Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 7. <hi>The ſons of ſtrangers ſhall build the walls,</hi> Iſaiah 60. and in the 61 Chap. <hi>And ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers ſhall ſtand up and feed their cattel, and the ſons of strangers ſhall be labourers and dreſſers of vines.</hi> Which ought to be underſtood of the ſervants of the Iews, or their hirelings, to which adde, ſix hundred ſuch, which you may every where finde in holy Writers.</p>
                  <p>But not onely by kinred, and expoſition of kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red did God diſtinguiſh the Iews from the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:62635:74"/>but would have them different in the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies it ſelf. <hi>He chuſed it for his inheritance, the kinred of Iacob, whom he loved,</hi> Pſalm 47. Where obſerve, that the kin of the Iews is diſtinguiſhed from the kin of the Gentiles, whom God did nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther love nor chuſe for his inheritance. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Philoſophers make the brures a diſtinct ſpecies from men: and with the holy Writers the ſpecies of the Iews is diſtinct from that of the Gentiles, whom you ſhall every where read con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſely mentioned with beaſts, and eſteemed beaſts in regard of the Iews, who by excellency are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led men, or by a more excellent title are called <hi>the men of God.</hi> You ſhall finde the ſpecies of the Iews peculiarly made and formed by God in <hi>Adam;</hi> you ſhall finde the ſpecies of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles promiſcuouſly created with the reſt of the creatures in the ſame day of Creation, which is diligently to be obſerved, that a day did not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh them whom the nature of their Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on did not diſtinguiſh.</p>
                  <p>The Iews were properly and apart from all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things created the frame and work of the ſecond Creation in <hi>Adam:</hi> the Gentiles pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly were the promiſcuous buds of the firſt Creation, together with all things elſe created, and the off-ſpring of that earth which likewiſe brought forth other creatures. Therefore did <hi>David</hi> call upon all Nations in theſe words; <hi>Hear all you Natious, hearken all you inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the earth, and ye ſons of men. David</hi> ſpoke palpable to the Gentiles, ſons of men, the Inhabitants of all the earth, whom he likewiſe
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:62635:74"/>calls born upon the earth to diſtinguiſh them from the Jews, who were not born upon the earth, or born from the earth, as the Gentiles, who were not created in the beginning of things, but form'd out of the clay in <hi>Adam.</hi> Furthermore, the Pſalmiſt comparing here the Gentiles to fooliſh beaſts, ſayes, They were made like to them who like beaſts were allotted to death, to eternal death, from which they ſhould not return to life, <hi>their graves are their houſes for ever,</hi> ſayes the Pſalm, as alſo in the ſame place, <hi>they ſhall not ſee light for ever:</hi> likewiſe <hi>David</hi> diſtinguiſhes the Jews from them in the ſame Pſalm, in which he exhorts them not to fear thoſe beaſts born upon the earth, who ſhould ſometime be governed by the Jews, <hi>The just ſhall have power over them in the morning:</hi> the juſt are the Jews, of whom we ſpoke before: that power of the Jews upon the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as alſo, that morning, ſhall be expounded in their own places. This Pſalm has given us a reaſon why the Iews ought not to fear theſe earth-born Gentiles of the firſt Creation, in the words following immediately, <hi>Their help ſhall grow old in the grave from their glory; but God ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem my ſoul from hell. David</hi> mixes his ſoul with the ſouls of the Iews: none of the Gentiles, ſayes he, ſhall redeem his ſoul; God ſhall redeem the ſouls of the Iews, when he ſhall receive the Iews, or at ſuch time as he ſhall receive the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected Iews: the Gentiles ſhall riſe to eternal death, or, which is the ſame, they ſhall die eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally by the fate of their Creation: the Iews ſhall riſe again to eternal life, or, which is the ſame,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:62635:75"/>they ſhall live eternally by the prerogative of their regeneration. Therefore let the Jews, who ſhall receive eternal life, little regard the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, deſtind to eternal death.</p>
                  <p>So farre were the Gentiles different in relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and kindred from the Jews, as thoſe divers <hi>ſpecies</hi> of creatures in unknown Countries are from thoſe which we know: ſo likewiſe were there more Nations unknown to the Jews, than were known; that is to ſay, in thoſe Countries which the Jews knew not: Nor were theſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions only unknown to the Jews, but likewiſe to their Fathers. I ſay, to their Fathers who were deriv'd from <hi>Adam:</hi> Which God having a regard to, threatens the Jews, Deut. 28. <hi>The Lord ſhall lead thee and thy King to a Nation whom thou and thy fathers knew not.</hi> He ſays thy Fathers indeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minately, in which are comprehended <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf, the firſt Father and clay of the Jews. Therefore all Nations were not known by <hi>Adam,</hi> and the poſterity of <hi>Adam,</hi> the Fathers of the Jews according to <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf, yea, were ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly unknown. But men are not ignorant of their own Off-ſpring. Nor had theſe Nations been unknown to the Jews, if they had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd from them or their fathers. But theſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions unknown to the Jews, and their anceſtors, were probably thoſe of <hi>America,</hi> the Southern, and the <hi>Greenlanders,</hi> and the reſt, to which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Jew, nor the reſt of the Gentiles as yet had acceſſe, To this adde what is written con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the King of the Jews, Pſalm 18. <hi>A people whom I know not ſhall ſerve me,</hi> and expound and

                  </p>
                  <p>And that by a moſt indubitable truth I may clear it, that the Gentiles were different in kinred and their firſt original from the Jews, take good heed to that which God ſays to <hi>Abraham,</hi> at which time he enjoyns circumciſion to him and all his houſe, Gen. 27. ſays he, <hi>The ſervant born in thy houſe, and bought with thy money ſhall be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, and whatſoever of your own linage;</hi> that is to ſay, whatſoever is not of the ſtock of <hi>Adam,</hi> who was the ſtock of <hi>Abraham.</hi> The ſtrangers were ſprung from another ſtock, then either <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi> or <hi>Abrahams.</hi> Nor will it be an ill ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, to take here for the linage of <hi>Abraham, Abraham</hi> himſelf, as he is taken for the father, and the Jews, with a regard to the promiſes made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> the firſt of all the Jews; in which ſenſe he is called the firſt and the linage of the Iews, the firſt Chapter of <hi>Matthew,</hi> which is the genealogie of Chriſt. And that thou maiſt know, &amp; grant thy ſelf, that the linage of <hi>Abraham</hi> in this place is to be recall'd to <hi>Adam</hi> the father of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> read what is written in the end of that 17 Chap. of Geneſis. <hi>And all the men of that houſe, as well born at home, as bought with money, and ſtrangers were circumciſed. Abram</hi> then had domeſticks his own Country people, and thoſe which were born in his houſe: that is to ſay, of of the ſame ſtock of <hi>Adam,</hi> as he was born; as alſo thoſe that were bought, who were of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtock and linage different from that of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and who had not their original from <hi>Adam,</hi>
                     <pb n="126" facs="tcp:62635:76"/>the ſtock of <hi>Abraham,</hi> or which is the ſame with <hi>Adamits,</hi> whom notwithſtanding <hi>Abraham</hi> is ſaid to have circumciſed, as if they had been <hi>Adamits,</hi> and of the ſtock of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſtock and originals of all Nations is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd and unknown for this reaſon; becauſe thoſe created from an unknown beginning, and innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable ages ago upon all the earth, propagation ſtill increaſing, by which they were throng'd one upon another, as likewiſe by manifold conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in which they were mingled one among a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, deſtroyed and confuſed the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of their firſt beginnings.

For their proper and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain original and ſtock is in <hi>Adam,</hi> from a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning very well known, and not very far di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, and deriv'd by a continual line to theſe days, by a line as yet different from the Gentiles. We have <hi>Joſephus</hi> a Jew himſelf, and a moſt acute Writer of the affaires of the Jews, witneſſe of this truth: where againſt <hi>Appion</hi> he aſſerts the proper original of his own Nation, which he there calls a conjunction, and which in his Jewiſh antiquities he likewiſe derives from <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Gentiles, who according to my ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were originally created in all the earth, are call'd almoſt every where <hi>ſons of men;</hi> becauſe they had their ſtocks and originals, not from one man, but innumerable fathers of the firſt creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

                  <p>The common opinion is, that the Gentiles ſprung from the Jews which fell over to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles; as for example, That ſome ſprung from <hi>Cain,</hi> who diſhinherited himſelf: from the ſons of <hi>Cham,</hi> whom <hi>Noe</hi> curſed: from the ſons of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael,</hi> the Baſtard: of the ſons of wicked <hi>Eſau;</hi> but every one ought to know, thoſe ſort of Jews were never accounted Strangers and Gentiles, but Jews, and brethren of the Jews; of which <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> is an eminent witneſſe, where he ſpeakes of thoſe that were fit to be denizen'd amongſt the Iews. <hi>Thou ſhalt not,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>loath the</hi> Edomite, <hi>becauſe he is thy brother, Nor the</hi> Egyptian, <hi>becauſe thou waſt a ſtranger in his land.</hi> Here obſerve, that the <hi>Edomites</hi> having loſt their liberty by fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling off from the ſons of <hi>Adam,</hi> are again reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as brethren of the Jews, and of the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent.

                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover, for the ſame reaſon as the earth brought forth graſs and trees and all things were enlivened; I ſay, as all things were created accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their own ſpecies and in their own dayes, in the ſelf-ſame progreſſive Creation upon the whole earth, whether known to our Fore-fathers or but lately, or not yet known: According to the ſame Analogy of Creation, we muſt believe, that men were made by God Male and Female in one day, with an uninterrupted Creation, and upon the whole earth, and that there was no place in the whole earth w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> brought forth graſs, foſtered trees &amp; cattel, which before the ſixth and laſt day of the abſolute Creation had not its own men and its own Lords. Beſides, theſe things were certainly created to ſerve man their Lord, ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in <hi>ſpecie,</hi> or men their Lords, mentioning the individuals: and God would have ſeem'd to have created ſomething in vain &amp; inconvenient, if upon that ſame day, when he ordained theſe things for the ſervice of men, he had not created men at the ſame time, who had either uſed them, or might
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:62635:79"/>have uſed them whereſoever they were.</p>
                  <p>But if we affirm <hi>Adam</hi> to be the firſt and the onely man by whom afterwards the colonies of men were drawn out and diſperſed over the earth, to what purpoſe in that vaſt ſpace of time in which the whole earth muſt needs receive its people from one man: I ſay, to what purpoſe ſhould the Countries of <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipodes,</hi> bring forth graſs and herbs? for what Lords uſe, ſhould the fruit have hung upon the trees in thoſe Countries? the cattel of, them whom ſhould they have helped? being meerly created for that purpoſe to help men: for either in that long ſpace of time, you muſt confeſs that they were created in vain, or created to an uſe that God had never appointed them for, or elſe, that men were there created to make uſe of them.</p>
                  <p>The world was created in the beginning eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way perfectly adorned, every way perfectly good, every way perfectly fair: But the World had been created in the beginning every way without ornament, every way imperfect in fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, every way imperfect in goodneſs, which is a ſin to think, if all the places in the earth had at firſt wanted their own men. The earth had been deformed if it had wanted graſs, trees, and crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; but they had been abſolutely deformed indeed, if they had wanted at the beginning their comlineſs and ornament, their men, for whom the earth was created, and all that therein is; and if the ground had wanted Tillers, as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires.</p>
                  <p>What was the intention of God in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:62635:79"/>of the world, is found by God's Decree in the preſervation and Government of the World. It is written, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. That God when he led <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt</hi> to lead them into the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> did thus provide for him, <hi>I will not throw ont the people of the Land of</hi> Canaan <hi>before thy face, leaſt the Land become waſte, and wild beaſts multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply againſt thee: I will by little and little drive them out of thy ſight till thou be encreaſed, and poſſeſs the Land.</hi> That is likewiſe written in <hi>Deut.</hi> 7. theſe words, <hi>The Lord ſhall conſume theſe Nations in thy ſight by little and little: thou canſt not overthrow them at once, least the wilde beaſts encreaſe againſt thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here is a two-fold condition why God would not in one year, and at one puſh, throw out all the Nations of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> in whoſe place he was to ſettle the Jews. The firſt was, becauſe he would not have that earth, which he was about to bleſs, to become ugly and ill-favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; for there is horror, not comlineſs in deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yea, ſolitarineſs is a mark of curſing. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did the Prophet weep when ſhe was curſed, <hi>Why doſt thou ſit a ſolitary City, that was full of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> And afterwards, <hi>All the comlineſs of</hi> Sion <hi>is departed from her: her Princes, her young men, and her virgins are gone into captivity.</hi> And <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ch. 64. <hi>The city of the holy one is laid waſte, Jeruſalem is deſolate.</hi> The ſecond caution was, Leſt the Beaſts ſhould grow and multiply in <hi>Canaan</hi> againſt the people of God. The firſt caution was, for comlineſs; the ſecond for ſecurity. God would not, as h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> might eaſily have done, quite deſtroy
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:62635:80"/>the Nations of <hi>Canaan;</hi> but drive them out by little and little, till the people of the Jews might encreaſe, and that Land might have its ful number of its own men, which ſhould be the glory of the earth. The Lord would have his people encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to a full and ſufficient number of inhabitants, which ſhould be able to defend themſelves from the beaſts of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and ſecure the people.</p>
                  <p>But if God had a double caution in this caſe for the comlineſs and ſecurity of the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> alone, although the Jews then abounded in number, and were grown to be many hundred thouſands, What care ſhall we think God took in the Creation of the World, for the comlineſs not onely of one Land, but alſo of the Lands of the whole World, leſt they ſhould be made de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate, if he had created one man and one Woman from the beginning in the earth. And if God would not expoſe many hundred thouſand Jews to the beaſts of one Land, ſhall we think, that he would expoſe one ſingle man and woman to the heaſts of all Lands? Certainly, if the beaſts of the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> had been ſo much multiplied againſt ſo many hundred thouſand Jews that dwelt in't: much more ſhould they have been multiplied againſt <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> being alone upon the whole earth.</p>

But it is impoſſble, that all thoſe things which are ſet down in the ſecond Chapter, could have been tranſacted in that time which is receiv'd from morning to evening. Therefore much leſſe in the half of that ſixth day, in which God firſt orea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all creatnres, then man. Let us tell every minute in which God was pleaſed to declare that all his works were perform'd with time, though he could have done them without time, We ſhal find no ſuch thing in the firſt creation of men, nor the action of the creation of male and female interrupted, as it is a long ſpace betwixt the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is firſt ſaid, That God created Adam <hi>of the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:62635:81"/>clay of the earth:</hi> Where obſerve, that God, who in the firſt Chapter created man not ſimply of the earth, but of that firſt matter of which he made the earth; in this ſecond Chapter fram'd <hi>Adam</hi> of the duſt of the earth. Obſerve that God, I ſay, who was in the firſt Chapter the Creator of man, was in the ſecond the framer of <hi>Adam.</hi> For which cauſe God is alſo the framer of the Jews<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Iſa. 45. <hi>Thus ſays the Lord, the holy One of Iſrael his maker.</hi> The maker of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> becauſe the maker of <hi>Adam,</hi> the firſt Father of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> But of this enough already.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is ſaid, <hi>That God breath'd upon the face of</hi> Adam <hi>the breath of life.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>He led him into Paradiſe.</hi> Take good notice of theſe words of <hi>Geneſis. God had planted from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

Certainly, if this <hi>Adam</hi> had been he who was created in the beginning, three dayes after the earth was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>Geneſis</hi> had not ſpoken of this <hi>Adam</hi> whom the Lord carryed into Paradiſe, <hi>God had planted Paradiſe from the beginning:</hi> Nay rather upon the <hi>third day</hi> he made Paradiſe; for the third day dry land appeared, and Paradiſe was planted, and the ſixth day man was created in his kind.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, it is written, that God gave this
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:62635:82"/>
                     <hi>Adam</hi> laws, what he ſhould eat, what he ſhould not eat, what he ſhould doe, what he ſhould ſhun. Obſerve here narrowly no Law given to the men of the firſt creation, which is related in the firſt Chapter of <hi>Geneſis:</hi> and no tree forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den them. <hi>And God ſaid, Behold I have given you every herb bearing ſeed upon earth, and all trees which have in them their ſeed, according to their kind, that it may be to you for meat.</hi> The tree of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of good and evil was forbidden <hi>Adam,</hi> the firſt man of the ſecond creation, which is mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the ſecond Chapter, <hi>Thou mayest eat of every tree in the garden; but of the tree of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of good and evil thou ſhalt not eat; For in the day that thou eateſt of it, thou ſhalt dye the death:</hi> But thoſe being divers ordinances, argue different times. Fifthly, the Scripture ſtammeringly ſhews us, That God had learn'd, as it were by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, in a certain time paſſed, That <hi>Adam</hi> being without a helper, had neither till'd, nor conveniently kept the Garden. Therefore God ſaid, <hi>It is not convenient that man ſhould be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. Let us make him a helper like unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>God brought to</hi> Adam <hi>all the creatures of the earth, and all the fowls of heaven.</hi> Which it is not likely he did in half a day. For thither muſt the Elephants come from the furtheſt parts of <hi>India</hi> and <hi>Africk,</hi> who are of a heavy and a ſlow pace. What ſhall I ſpeak of ſo many ſeveral <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> of creatures and fowls, unknown to our He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſphere, who muſt ſwim ſo much Sea, paſs over ſo much Land, to come from <hi>America</hi> to <hi>Meſopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamia,</hi>
                     <pb n="139" facs="tcp:62635:82"/>and there receive their names.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, <hi>He ſaw what he would call them. He ſaw;</hi> that is, that he took notice that he ſhould fitly call every one of them, and in every name he diſputed with himſelf; that is, he had thoſe operations of mind which are diſtinguiſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, diſcurſively, and in time. Nor is it poſſible that <hi>Adam</hi> could in one half of a day ſee all the creatures of the earth, and the fowls of heaven, and then premeditately give every one of them a convenient name; which neither in pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of their names, not in a continual rehearſing of them, he could have perform'd in ſo ſhort a time.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, <hi>God ſent a deep ſteep upon</hi> Adam, <hi>and when he had ſlept</hi> a long and deep ſleep, <hi>God took one of his ribs, and filled up the fleſh for it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ninthly, <hi>He made a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>oman of the rib.</hi> Nor did the Grecian Jews believe that the rib of <hi>Adam</hi> was made a woman the ſame day that <hi>Adam</hi> was made; for they affirm, That <hi>Adam</hi> was made in the New Moon, that is, the firſt day of the Moon. But <hi>Eve</hi> was made the ſecond day of the Moon. Which the famous <hi>Salmaſius</hi> has mentioned in his Climacterical years, and refuted the ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Jews; and withall, has cleared their Opinion, who believ'd that there was the diſtance of a day betwixt their creation.</p>
                  <p>Tenthly, <hi>God brought</hi> Eve <hi>to</hi> Adam. If you all reckon theſe things ſeverally, not half a day, not a week, not a moneth will ſuffice for half of them.</p>
                  <p>Nor is it to be overſlip'd, that <hi>Adam</hi> called
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:62635:83"/>that Female a <hi>woman,</hi> as being taken out of a man, nor call'd her man, as the females were in the firſt creation. <hi>He created them male and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male.</hi> For this man in the ſecond creation did ſo much excell all other men who were created before, and begotten till his time; for which cauſe he was to be the firſt, and the Father of a Nation choſen by God, and by which he was to repreſent, by Gods decree, all mankind. That he could find no fit helper for him amongſt all the women of the former creation; But a woman muſt be fram'd for him more excellent than all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other women. And hence it comes to paſſe; that Marriages with the reſt of the Nations are ſtrictly forbidden the Jews: and that the marria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the ſons of God muſt not be made with the daughters of men, left the holy and elect people ſhould be defiled with the prophane Nations, and thoſe that were created altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a huddle.</p>

                  <p>THey which take pains in reading of the holy Scripture, and are ſerious in the peruſal of
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:62635:83"/>them, find three men marvellouſly and peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brought forth. The firſt, is <hi>Adam.</hi> The ſecond, <hi>Iſaac.</hi> The third, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The firſt was <hi>Adam,</hi> whoſe mother was the Earth, God his father. The ſecond <hi>Iſaac,</hi> whoſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was <hi>Abraham,</hi> God was his mother: <hi>for it left off with</hi> Sarah <hi>to be according to the manner of women,</hi> Gen. 18. To which God alluding, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 46. ſpeaking to the Jews, the ſons of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> ſays, <hi>he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed them in his womb.</hi> The third is <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> whoſe mother was a Virgin, and whoſe father God. God was father both to <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> under whoſe imputation all the world was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to fall. God was the father, <hi>Adam,</hi> was the ſon of God. <hi>Chriſt</hi> was the ſon of God, and God the ſon. <hi>Adam</hi> was a ſinner, <hi>Christ</hi> was juſt. In all other things <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> were alike. <hi>Adam</hi> was a type of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and oppoſite to <hi>Chriſt. Iſaac</hi> was a type of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and in the middle 'twixt <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Chriſt. Christ</hi> was a Prototype of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and an Antitype of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The common Opinion is, That <hi>Adam</hi> was cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated by God of a full age, of the perfect ſtature of a man, and that the day wherein he was created, he might be a man of thirty yeers of age, at which age, Chriſt died. Truely, I ſhall rather think, that <hi>Adam</hi> was in all things like Chriſt, except the juſtice of Chriſt; as Chriſt was made in all things like <hi>Adam,</hi> except the ſin of <hi>Adam:</hi> and that <hi>Adam</hi> not ſtreight, nor the firſt day, but by leiſure, and by ſeveral ages, ſucceſsively grew from infancy and youth to man's eſtate, by as many
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:62635:84"/>degrees as Chriſt arived at the ſame ſtate at which <hi>Iſaac</hi> arived at it, being himſelf likewiſe miraculouſly brought forth: and as other men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten after the ordinary manner, ariſe from chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to be men.</p>
                  <p>And he ſhall finde this to be moſt probable, whoſoever ſhall ſeriouſly peruſe the Hiſtory of <hi>Adam,</hi> from the framing of him, till the framing of his wife <hi>Eve;</hi> for God framed <hi>Adam</hi> out of Paradiſe, whom he afterwards carried into Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, that he might <hi>manure it,</hi> ſayes Geneſis. Hence I gather, that <hi>Adam</hi> was framed an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant without Paradiſe, becauſe I read, that he was carried into Paradiſe to <hi>till it,</hi> at ſuch time of his age and ſtrength as he was able to perform it.</p>
                  <p>Again, I believe that that Paradiſe was that place of the Holy Land which is called <hi>Arabia felix;</hi> for it is bounded Chap. 2. <hi>Geneſis,</hi> By <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gris</hi> and <hi>Euphrates,</hi> two Rivers joining their ſtreams in their courſe towards <hi>Arabia,</hi> fall into the Bay of <hi>Perſia. Arabia felix</hi> is likewiſe to be underſtood the <hi>Paradiſe of the Lord,</hi> in that place of <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. where <hi>Lot</hi> lifting up his eyes ſaw all the Region about <hi>Jordan,</hi> which was altogether watered like the Paradiſe of the Lord, and like <hi>Egypt,</hi> as thou comeſt from <hi>Segor:</hi> for it is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that <hi>Geneſis</hi> has compared and joyned to <hi>Arabia felix</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> two neighbouring Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and two of the moſt pleaſant.</p>
                  <p>I think that <hi>Adam</hi> was brought to that Holy Land, even as I finde <hi>Abraham</hi> led to the ſame Land: that <hi>Adam</hi> might have the firſt natural poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:62635:84"/>of it, the firſt and the father of all the Jews, and which by a ſtricter title, and a more peculiar obligation, God might afterwards promiſe &amp; give <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to the Jews his poſterity, being <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſeed, and his own. <hi>Adam</hi> being a young man and cultivating of Paradiſe, God thought of giving him a Wife; and being as it were uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain whom he ſhould beſtow upon him, he brought unto him all the creatures of the earth, and all the Fowls of heaven, that he might ſee what he would call them: for every thing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever <hi>Adam</hi> called it, that is the name there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
                  <p>Here I imagine two things: firſt, becauſe it is ſaid; that he might ſee what <hi>Adam</hi> would call them; that he might ſee, denotes, that <hi>Adam</hi> made uſe of his reaſon in the proper and determinate Names, which he gave to all the living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and fowls. And hence I gather, That <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> being now of ripe age, was taught the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral hiſtory of all Creatures and Fowls. As is known of <hi>Moſes,</hi> whom we read to have been, by the care of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> daughter, bred in all the wiſdom of the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> As alſo Rabbi <hi>Moſes Ben-Maymon,</hi> makes mention of the books of his Predeceſſors, which make relation of <hi>Adam's</hi> Maſter, whoſe name, ſay they, was <hi>Somboſcer.</hi> And although I give little credit to the Fables of the Rabbins, yet there is nothing ſo fabulous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but has a taſt of an ancient truth.</p>
                  <p>Then it is written, <hi>all which</hi> Adam <hi>called any living thing; that is the name of it.</hi> Hence I gueſs, that at what time <hi>Adam</hi> did conceive the nature
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:62635:85"/>of all creatures and fowls, he at the ſame time ſet them down in writing, and made a book of all their names; for how could it come to paſſe, that every thing which <hi>Adam</hi> called any thing, ſhould be the name of it, unleſſe <hi>Adam</hi> at the ſame time when he nam'd them, had then compoſed a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionary of them for the uſe of poſterity, leaſt <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> himſelf ſhould have forgotten all thoſe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving creatures and fowls, which he was never afterwards to ſee? For all Lands and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries are not ſtored with all manner of Cattel and Fowls.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Adam</hi> call'd by their names all creatures, and all Fowls, and all Beaſts of the earth. <hi>But for Adam,</hi> ſayes Geneſis, <hi>was not found a helper like to himſelf.</hi> It would be abſurd to think, that a helper was ſought for <hi>Adam</hi> amongſt the Beaſts of the earth, and the Fowls of heaven. For, what ſimilitude or relation has a man with a four-footed Beaſt or a Bird? But here you muſt obſerve, that the Gentiles, and thoſe men of the firſt creation, are here numbred amongſt the reſt of the living creatures, as you ſhall finde them without diſtinction called with the reſt of the beaſts, <hi>The People that treads the earth,</hi> Iſa. 42. Yea, that they were called Beaſts by the Jews, and ſo eſteem'd, as is prov'd before. This then is the meaning of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> That <hi>Adam</hi> did not find a helper amongſt the Females of thoſe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that is, the Gentiles; For <hi>Adam</hi> ſuch an excellent man, who was <hi>Iſch,</hi> an excellent wife muſt be choſen, who ſhould be <hi>Iſcha,</hi> and not an ordinary and Gentile-woman.</p>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:62635:85"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Therefore a wife was fram'd for Adam.</hi> But, as a houſe does not ariſe from the bottom, nor is perfected ſo ſoon, as in one day to be inhabited: ſo doe I believe that <hi>Eve</hi> was not made ſo perfect in that very day wherein ſhe was taken out of the ſide of <hi>Adam,</hi> that ſhe was marriageable.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, <hi>Eve</hi> was a myſtical figure of the Church of Chriſt, for that ſame reaſon as we laid before <hi>Adam</hi> was a type of Chriſt. Yea, and that is moſt certain, that the marriage of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> was a Sacrament and myſtery, ſignifying that unanimous conjunction by which God adheres to his Church. Again, we underſtand that the Church, the ſpouſe of Chriſt, was built thus, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. as we find <hi>Eve</hi> built in this Chapter of <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi> where God ſpeaks to his Church in theſe words, <hi>I multiplyed thee as the herb of the field. Thou waſt multiplyed and made great, and thou en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'dſt in, and came to have womens attire. Thy breſts ſwell'd, and thy hair ſprouted; and behold thy time a time of lovers.</hi> I gueſſe that <hi>Eve,</hi> the wife of <hi>Adam,</hi> grew from her infancle to ripe age by little and little, as a houſe grows, as trees grow, which are call'd the <hi>sprouts of the field,</hi> from twigs to large branches: ſo as we read in this place the Church did, which was the Spouſe of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>The Lord brought <hi>Eve</hi> to <hi>Adam.</hi> I gueſſe that <hi>Eve</hi> being now of age, and ready for a man, was brought to <hi>Adam</hi> at that ſame time when <hi>Adam</hi> was of ripe age about the three and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth year of his age: ſo as <hi>Adam</hi> may be thought to have ſinned in the ſame year of his age as
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:62635:86"/>Chriſt dyed for the ſinne of <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which things if they be ſo, what diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence was there betwixt the forming of <hi>Adam</hi> and building of <hi>Eve,</hi> which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed in the ſecond Chapter of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> and the creation of man, whom God created male and female upon the ſixth day of the creation, which is made mention of Chapter 1. of the ſaid <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes?</hi>

                  <p>WIthout doubt it is ſo.

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:62635:86"/>more wonderfull manner, did live and grow. Which, that by the Hiſtory of <hi>Geneſis</hi> it may be more clear, let us go on. After <hi>Adam</hi> had ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <hi>he was afraid, becauſe he was naked. And God made coats of skins for</hi> Adam <hi>and his wife, and cloth'd them with the skins of cattel which had been kill'd.</hi> With which it is probable men in thoſe dayes did uſe to cloath themſelves; but who from thence will not gueſſe, that there were in thoſe dayes Curriers, Shoo-makers, and Skin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Adam</hi> knew his wiſe <hi>Eve,</hi> and ſhe conceived and bare <hi>Cain</hi> her firſt-born, then <hi>Abel</hi> her younger ſon. And <hi>Adam</hi> divided his ſubſtance among his children, being men of age, as men do who are under the verge of the Civil Law. He gave his lands to till to <hi>Cain,</hi> and his ſheep to keep to <hi>Abel.</hi> Therefore there was at that time a <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum,</hi> as there is, and has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in all ſocieties well ordered. <hi>Cain</hi> had his Patrimony and his grounds to till. <hi>Abel</hi> had his own goods, his ſheep to keep. Such diviſion being made betwixt them, as uſes to be made by all good Maſters of Families.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cain</hi> was a Husbandman. <hi>Abel</hi> a keeper of ſheep, He that ſpeaks of tilling, preſuppoſes a great mony other arts: and he that ſpeaks of a husbandman, pre-ſuppoſes a great many other artificers. But if there was no artificer in thoſe dayes beſide <hi>Cain,</hi> certainly <hi>Cain</hi> was a very buſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body. Therefore he digg'd Iron-Mines, made Fornaces, made his Hammers and his Anvile, and other tools to make his Plow-ſhare, ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:62635:87"/>his hatchets, with which he was to cut down timber to make his Ploughs, his Harrows, his Carts, and the like. Then, if of that Corn which he reap'd, he made bread, then <hi>Cain</hi> too digg'd the quarry to make his Mill to grind; or, if they u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed no Mills in thoſe dayes, <hi>Cain</hi> was carryed to thoſe places where Knaves make their moan, in kneading of brown bread, and made himſelf a bake-houſe to bake his bread in. Therefore <hi>Cain</hi> was a tiller, a harveſt-man, and a baker: And <hi>Cain</hi> had all theſe arts alone, for the exerciſing of which ſo many artificers are required; which could not be found out but by long ſtudy and long experience. All theſe things are nothing. The nobleſt of all men, who had God for his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father, and the Earth his Grandmother, was tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into the Iron Mines, and quarry-pits, or in the pounding Mill to break Corn, whither thoſe were carried who were condemned to digging of Metals, or ſervants, who were to be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>Let us come to <hi>Abel.</hi> It is written, he was a keeper of ſheep. <hi>Abel</hi> fed and kept his own ſheep. Why did <hi>Abel</hi> keep them? What thieves ſhould he fear, beſide his Father, Mother, and Brother, if there was no more upon earth? But of Wolves and ravenous beaſts <hi>Abel</hi> had as great reaſon to be afraid, as his flock: leſt leaving them they might have fallen upon him.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, it is probable that <hi>Adam</hi> liv'd ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in that time in an incloſed Village, or a fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced City. For after that <hi>Cain</hi> had reſolved upon that wicked deed which he was hatching, <hi>He
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:62635:87"/>ſaid to his brother</hi> Abel, <hi>Let us go forth: And when they were in the field,</hi> Cain <hi>roſe up against his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and ſlew him.</hi> That <hi>Let us go forth</hi> ſhews, That <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> were either ſhut up within the incloſure of ſome Hamlet, or within the walls of ſome town. Within what incloſure, or within what Town-walls was <hi>Cain</hi> afraid to be apprehended and to be carried to priſon, if open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and in the ſight of the men of the Village, or of the Citizens, he had kill'd his brother? And he kill'd him when they were in the <hi>Field,</hi> which is oppoſite to the <hi>City.</hi> Which obſerve. He kild him when they were alone, without witneſſes: which Robbers and wicked men, who do ill deeds and commit Murther, uſe to doe. That there was rewards for good deeds &amp; puniſhment forbad deeds at that time, hence chiefly appears becauſe God ſpeaking to <hi>Cain,</hi> being angry, and his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance fall'n, becauſe <hi>Abel</hi> was in better eſteeme than he, ſaith, <hi>Why art thou angry? a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For it is well known in many places of the Holy Scripture, that judgement amongſt the Eaſtern people uſed to be given in the gates: Yea, yet with them a gate is the ſame as a Court: For God told <hi>Cain,</hi> if he did evil, he ſhould be carried before the Judges, who ſhould puniſh him for his wickedneſſe. The which <hi>Michael Marole,</hi> Abbot of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>illeloing,</hi> very learnedly obſerv'd, and very nobly did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to me.</p>
                  <p>Let us preſſe it further. From what Robbers
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:62635:88"/>did <hi>Cain</hi> get a ſword to draw his brothers bloud? Whom did <hi>Cain</hi> fear after he knew that his ſlaying of his brother was blown abread?

                  <p>Therfore he fled from their juriſdiction who had power to puniſh him. And fled, like all guilty perſons, who find that they have deſerv'd ill, and ſtreight betake themſelves to flight. I ſay, he fled to another Countrey. <hi>To the Eaſt of Eden,</hi> ſayes Geneſis. The words that <hi>Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Theſe things which <hi>Joſephus</hi> being himſelf a Jew, and a great Defender of the Jews antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties has written of this ſubject, are worth our
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:62635:88"/>knowledge. One, who (it's to be thought) would write nothing, which he had not either received in antient tradition, by word of mouth, or gain'd it by reading. He tells us, that <hi>Cain</hi> flying to the Eaſtward of <hi>Eden,</hi> did not change for a better courſe of life; but that by force and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine he increaſed his ſtock, <hi>Getting,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>from all parts companious of his robbery and villany, and became their teacher in all wickedneſs.</hi> The famous and learned <hi>Iſmael Buillaldus</hi> that he had read ſomething much to the ſame purpoſe in a Greek Manuſcript in the Kings Library, tranſlated out of the Hebrew Chronicle, which being render'd in Latine, ſounds thus, <hi>And when</hi> Cain <hi>had cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel'd a great way, he came to a place called</hi> Cainan, <hi>and did all manner of wickedneſs, falling upon paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers in the way, robbing and ſlaying them, of whoſe ſpoils he got a great ſum of mony.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But pray what manner of men were thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions whom <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſayes that <hi>Cam</hi> gathered from all parts? Would not he rather have called thoſe men the Grandchildren of <hi>Cain,</hi> if he had thought them to have been ſo? But he only calls them <hi>Cains</hi> Fellowes, or his Companions, as Souldiers are call'd by their Officers &amp; Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. And againſt whom did <hi>Cain</hi> provide this band of wicked men? Would he have arm'd his own Grandchildren againſt his own Grandchildren? Nor muſt we imagine that this was the minde of <hi>Joſephus.</hi> To what purpoſe ſhould he have rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his Grandchildren againſt his Grandchildren?

But becauſe it is ſaid, That arguments joyn'd are more ſtrong; we deſire to joyn to theſe arguments of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, thoſe monuments, which are a great many, of the creation of the world and the firſt men, whom the moſt antient and beſt-eſteemed Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers and Hiſtorians have delivered to have been many ages ago.</p>
                  <p>And thoſe which argued concerning the world were diſtributed into two Claſſes. One was of thoſe, who affirmed that the world was without beginning and ending, that it was from eternity, and ſhould remain to eternity. Others diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that the world had a beginning, and ſhould have an end; but both granted, that the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and ending of it were neither of them known. They that ſaid, that the world was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, believ'd that there was a God, who was not begotten, and who never ſhould die; Yea, they would have God and the world to be one thing; and that God had put on the world: And that <hi>Jove,</hi> the greateſt of the Gods, was the whole world, a living ſoul compos'd of living ſouls, and a God compos'd of gods, as of his parts. For they made the parts of the world of the number of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Gods; for there were eternal Gods, to wit, the Sun and Moon, and the reſt of the ſtars, which were in continual motion; and, which had no beginning, nor ever ſhould have an end. And for this did they affirm, that the Univerſe was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal; becauſe, if it was begotten, it was begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of nothing. But that nothing could come of
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:62635:91"/>nothing, they did imagine granted. Likewiſe they gueſſed the eternity of the world, by that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal perſeverance and conſtancy by which the world is permanent. and alwayes like to it ſelf. Therefore did they ſay it was immutable, becauſe it was always ſuch, and ſhould be alwayes ſuch as it now is. To which adde that of <hi>Eccleſiaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,</hi> Chap. 1. <hi>What is that which was, but it ſhall be. There is nothing new under the Sun. Nor can any one ſay, Loe this is new: For it hath been in the ages which have been before us.</hi> And the ſame Sun ſtill ariſing. This was certainly the cauſe that there were Adulterers too before <hi>Helen;</hi> that there were Captains before <hi>Idomeneus</hi> and <hi>Sthenelus;</hi> and that <hi>Troy</hi> was taken before <hi>Agamemnon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>God made Eternity, Eternity made the world,</hi> ſaid <hi>Mercury</hi> in <hi>Poemander.</hi> Therefore God was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore eternity, and eternity before the world. But as the Sun being the cauſe of the day, is born with the day, not before the day: and as God, the cauſe of eternity, was not rather before eternity, but from eternity with eternity: So the eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which made the world, was not ſo much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world, as with the world from eternity: Wherefore the ſame <hi>Poemander</hi> would have eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to be in God, and the world in eternity: Yea, he ſaid that eternity was the ſoul of the world, as God was the ſoul of eternity. He ſaid then, that the world was the work of eternity; that it was not made at a ſet time, but alwayes, and from eternity: and ſince eternity never ceaſes, the world ſhould likewiſe never ceaſe.</p>
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:62635:91"/>
                  <p>Beſides action was always in God a power un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanquiſhable; for God was never idle: which we perceive by the world, which is the image of God. For there is no reſt in all the arts of the world. For the world is always big, and alwayes brings forth, according to the nature of time and place. Therefore we ſhall eaſily imagine that the world had no birth, if we have regard to God, in whom the world &amp; all creatures muſt be from eternity, from whom they muſt needs have their birth, and of whom God in his good pleaſure tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel'd with from all eternity. But if we believe that God always, and from eternity carried the world in his mind and will, we muſt needs believe, That God, by that unvanquiſhable power by which he acts and brings forth always, did beget the world from eternity.</p>
                  <p>On the contrary, they that aſſign'd to the world a beginning, teach us that things had a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, the forms of which, by little and little this Univerſe did receive. And that the unſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Globe of the world became one lump, and that the firſt creatures crept out of the earth, and believed that the world was amazed at the ſight of a new Sun. Nay, <hi>Porphyrius</hi> has very elegant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly decipher'd the youth of Nature, where he ſpeaks of the firſt and moſt antient ſacrifice of the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> He ſays, <hi>There ſeems a great ſpace of time to have paſt over ſince the Egyptians, the wiſeſt of men, began at home to ſacrifice to the heavenly Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, not with the firſt fruits of Myrrhe, Caſſia, or Frankincenſe, but with green graſſe, which with up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifted hands, as being the firſt gown of teeming na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, her did preſent.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Porphyrius</hi> did not ſay that an infinite time had paſt, but <hi>ſeem'd to have paſt.</hi> Which obſerve, to be according to the opinion of thoſe, who ſaid that <hi>the world from all eternity did rowl with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual motion, nor that it was begotten at any certain time. At a certain time;</hi> that is, at a known time. In which ſence <hi>Sanchoniato,</hi> who liv'd before the deſtruction of <hi>Troy,</hi> ſaid, that the beginnings of the world were infinite, and that the world ſhould have no end, but after many ages.</p>
                  <p>They likewiſe believed, that the perpetual mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wherewith the world is rowl'd, had likewiſe begotten returnable time. Time, I ſay, which has from many ages laſted, &amp; ſhall laſt out many more. As alſo they granted the parts of this time to be minutes, hours, days, months, ages, ages of ages, or that age which is extended from age to age. There were likewiſe years of years, the twelf-years, eight years, and nineteen years amongſt the Greeks. The things which <hi>Claudius Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſim</hi> a man of moſt excellent learning has writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in his Preface to his Climacterical years, are things curious and choice.

That great Serpent which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>virons the care of the great year, is ſaid to be alwayes green in her ſcales; becauſe this ſort of creature is believ'd, by reaſon of the force and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of ſpirit that it hath, not only to put off old age, and become young again, but likewiſe to receive greater encreaſe of ſtrength: as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe becauſe the nature of it is lively and fiery. For which cauſe <hi>Virgil</hi> has ſet forth his Serpents <hi>blustering with blood and fire,</hi> which agrees very well with the great year, which has a green and freſh old age, alwayes taking and retaking, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calling and furniſhing time out of his large bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom.</p>
                  <p>That which we have ſaid of Serpents turning back to bite their own tails, agrees with theſe Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riodical years, whoſe beginnings are certain and known, and have certain and known ends, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be theſe leſſer years, or the greater year, whom we alwayes make periodical, and confine within certain limits. It is not ſo with the great year, which comprehends the paſt periods of all the years, both leſſes and the greater, which is call'd the age of ages, or that age which begins at the beginning of ages, and ſhall endure to the end of them. For this age has no determinate pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod. It depends of a beginning not imaginable, and although it alwayes rends towards its end by a reſtleſſe motion, yet it never reaches it. For which cauſe this Serpent of <hi>Claudian</hi> does not fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſſe this year, but rather <hi>Lucans</hi> Bear, which turning his teeth towards his tail, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours

                  </p>
                  <p>That age, which runs out from the beginning of things created, and ſhall onely ſtay when there is an end of them, and which is time it ſelf pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, and a comprehenſion of all things paſt, and to come, is call'd <hi>the body of times</hi> by <hi>Tertullian,</hi> Apol. 26. But is call'd <hi>the age of ages,</hi> and <hi>the age,</hi> ſimply: and <hi>the day of eternity,</hi> by holy Authors. But if the great and returning year of <hi>Cicero</hi> doth ſo aſtoniſh him in numbring thoſe ages: If the Cave of <hi>Claudian,</hi> which is the ſame as <hi>Ciceroes</hi> great year, is unknown and hid from our ſenſes, ſcarce acceſſible to the Gods: In what clouds and darkneſſe doe you think ſhall mens minds be, in recounting all thoſe ages which make up eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity it ſelf?

                  <p>This was that, which the Author of <hi>Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticus</hi> wrote concerning, in the beginning; <hi>Who can tell the ſand of the ſea, the drops of the rain, and the days of eternity?</hi> And in the 18 Chapt. of the day of eternity, <hi>As a drop of the ſea, or a grain of ſand, ſo are a thouſand years in the account of eternity.</hi> Therefore did <hi>Socrates</hi> call thoſe

The knowledge of the original of the world, which is only competent to God himſelf, deceives men, becauſe it is hid from men: nor can we find out the times and ages of the world. And if the Son of God, as he was man, knew not the end of the world, why ſhould we, poor men, ſearch the beginnings of it? For the future, and that which is paſt, are the ſame in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of time. <hi>The times are not hid from the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,</hi> Job 20. <hi>And belongs not to us to know them,</hi> Acts laſt Chapter.

                  <p>But as Geographers uſe to place Seas upon that place of the Globe which they know not: ſo Chronologers, who are near of kin to them, uſe to blot out ages paſt, which they know not. They drown thoſe Countries which they know not: Theſe with cruel pen kill the times they heard not of, and deny that which they know not. The Grecians divided the times into thoſe which were unknown, into thoſe which were Heroick &amp; fabulous, into ſuch as were Hiſtorical, and which they knew to be true: The unknown times were thoſe with them which paſt from the beginning of things to the Flood; which time, whether it had a beginning or not, certainly by computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cannot be comprehended, as <hi>Cenſorinus</hi> ſince <hi>Varro</hi> affirms. The fabulous and Heroick times were thoſe which were from the Floud to the firſt Olympiad: unknown likewiſe: Nor is it plainly known how long <hi>Inachus</hi> was from <hi>Ogy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi>

                  <p>But whatſoever we have learned in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of things, we owe to the Greeks, and to Latine Authors, who have written after them. But ſayes he, all things among the Greeks are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry late, and you ſhall find that the building of Towns, and the invention of Arts, was immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately found out, and but a day old. And they laſt of all began to write Hiſtorie. But the <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and <hi>Phoenicians</hi> had a conſtant record of things paſt, the Greeks themſelves confeſſe. Thoſe ſame Greeks, but very lately learned the uſe of Letters from the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> being taught by <hi>Cadmus,</hi> who was himſelf a <hi>Phoenician;</hi> for which cauſe, it was doubtfull, whether the Greeks had any uſe of Letters in the time of the Trojan ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition: as <hi>Joſephus</hi> has written againſt <hi>Appi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> But the Greeks, that could ſcarce aſſert their own affaires for truth from the firſt Olympiad, nor could be ſure of any thing that was before the firſt Olympiad: yet, by hearing and reading, knew ſuch things as came to their ears concerning the <hi>Chaldaeans, Egyptians, Scythians,</hi> and <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> the moſt noble of Nations; but by alluſion, and ſo confuſedly deliver'd, that thoſe things which from their Predeceſſors they receiv'd confus'd, to their Succeſſors they in like manner return'd them. And if the particulars taken ſeverally beget no faith; yet being joyn'd together, they will prove, that thoſe Nations many ages before were reign'd o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and were famous both in peace and war.</p>

                     <hi>Diodorus Siculus,</hi> a moſt famous man, and who had a great opinion of learning amongſt all, by reading, enquiring, and travelling <hi>Europe, Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Africa</hi> forty years, had furniſh'd his Library with many antient and exquiſite Volumes. This he relates concerning the <hi>Chaldaeans,</hi> That they thought very long agoe that the world, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to its nature, was eternal, which had no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, nor ſhould have any corruption in order to an end thereof.

                     </hi> thought it hard to be believ'd, but not impoſſible; as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving himſelf, that the motion of the eternal cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit, by an eternal Law, was ordered by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellations and the ſtars. And that was it which made <hi>Cicero,</hi> living at the ſame time with <hi>Diodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> write the ſame things of the <hi>Chaldaeans,</hi> whom he calls <hi>Babylonians. For they deceive us,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>in ſaying that the</hi> Chaldaeans <hi>buſied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs four hundred and ſeventy thouſand years in cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culating the nativities of all children; for if they had ſo done, they had not left off. But we know no body
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:62635:96"/>that can inform us that ſuch a thing is practiſed, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was. Cicero</hi> refutes not the account of years in that place, which he did not think impoſſible, otherwiſe by impoſſibility he had refuted it; but the vanity of the <hi>Caldaeans</hi> predictions, thoſe care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful trials, and experiments given by tradition con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Nativities of Children, all through the continuation of ſo many years; which to <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> ſeem'd improbable. For why, ſayes he, ſhould the <hi>Chaldaeans</hi> have diſcontinued, and not in his time likewiſe have calculated Nativities? Beſides, that wonderful number of years, which as <hi>Diodorus</hi> and <hi>Cicero</hi> relates, the <hi>Chaldaeans</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed either in the obſervation of the ſtars, or in the raiſing of Schemes in Nativities, is not dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from thoſe bundles of times and years, which (as I ſhewed before) the <hi>Chaldaeans</hi> made uſe of in the computation of the inaugurating of their Kings. For the number of thoſe times was ſo great, and return'd ſo far upon former ages, that they numbred not thoſe many ſums of ages by years, not by thouſands of years, but by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral compactions of years.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Egyptians</hi> contending in Aſtrologie with the <hi>Chaldaeans,</hi> thought that the motions of all the ſtars and conſtellations, and every particular one of them, was ordained from eternity. And the ſame <hi>Diodorus</hi> affirms, that they had preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in memorie the deſcriptions of thoſe moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, all through an incredible computation of years; As it is likewiſe known that they kept the Hiſtories of their Kings all along, through incredible computations of time. Having Gods
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:62635:97"/>for their Kings, and Heroes, and men. Of whoſe moſt ancient Dynaſties marvellous things are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by <hi>Herodotus,</hi> and other Writers of the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian</hi> affairs. <hi>Salmaſius,</hi> the learnedſt both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thoſe <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> makes mention of a moſt antient Writer who ſets down thirty Dynaſties of Kings, and writes, that they endur'd <hi>three Myriads</hi> of years, &amp; expounds thoſe myriads to have been ten thouſand thouſand, and three thouſand years. There are thoſe in <hi>Egypt,</hi> who ſay, that the times of their King, God <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ulcan,</hi> was worn out of memory: whom they affirm to have reign'd infinite ages in <hi>Egypt:</hi> And that the Sun, the Son of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ulcan,</hi> did poſſeſſe the Kingdom of <hi>Egypt</hi> ſix hundred thouſand, ſix hundred and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty ſix years after his Father. <hi>Salmaſius,</hi> the moſt acute inquirer of their affairs, recounting the number in his Climacterical years.</p>
                  <p>Nor muſt we traduce the truth of <hi>Herodotus,</hi> and other Writers of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> affairs, becauſe <hi>Diodorus</hi> has written, <hi>That they embrac'd thoſe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful relations for truths.</hi> For thoſe words of <hi>Diodorus</hi> have relation to ſomething elſe, than thoſe almoſt infinite accounts of time. For <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi> in ſo doing, ſhould have turned thoſe mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous relations back upon himſelf; who doubted not to relate thoſe four hundred and ſeventy thouſand years of the <hi>Chaldaeans:</hi> which were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo hard to be believ'd. For it is indeed probable, that <hi>Herodotus,</hi> an excellent Writer, and very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate in moſt things, and <hi>Diodorus</hi> himſelf an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertor of Hiſtorical truths, ſpake nothing of thoſe accounts, but what they had heard either from
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:62635:97"/>
                     <hi>Egyptian</hi> Prieſts, out of their records, and had acuratly examin'd, and ſeen them in <hi>Egypt;</hi> which for their own parts both <hi>Herodotus</hi> and <hi>Diodorus</hi> ingenuouſly confeſſe. But <hi>Diodorus</hi> himſelf alſo relates this of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> nor thinks it any wonder, in part 2. book 1. of his Library, <hi>That the Egyptian Kings born in that Country rul'd Egypt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove</hi> 4700 <hi>Yeares.</hi> Whoſe times we ſhall find to have ſurpaſſed above threeſcore thouſand years, if we reckon that there is already a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand two hundred years paſt, ſince threeſcore of the Kings of <hi>France</hi> began to reign.</p>
                  <p>But to ſay, that thoſe thouſands of years, and myriads which I have mentioned, are to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of Lunary years, or of the the third part of the year, as they ſay it was ſometimes divided into the Spring, Summer, and Autumn, were to make Objections to no purpoſe. Since <hi>Diodorus</hi> himſelf ſays this of the <hi>Chaldaeans, That they ſaid, that the Sun and Moon runs through the twelve ſigns of the Zodiack; That the Sun ends his courſe in a year; The Moon in a month.</hi> As likewiſe <hi>Herodotus</hi> ſays this expreſly of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> that he had learned of the Inhabitants of <hi>Heliopolis,</hi> who were thought the moſt skilfull of all the <hi>Egyptians, That the</hi> Egyptians <hi>were the firſt of all men that found out years, and divided them into twelve months.</hi> This diviſion of years and months, is meant in the firſt Chapter of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> where he ſpeaks thus of the creation of the Sun and Moon. <hi>Let there be lights in the firmament of heaven, and let them divide the night and the day, and let them be for ſigns and times, and dayes and years.</hi> For the dayes in this place
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:62635:98"/>are moneths, which are divided into thirty days: and years, which are made up of twelve moneths. The Sun, being the greater Luminary, had alot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him the greateſt parts of the year, The Moon had alotted to it the leſſe, that is, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the moneths. Therefore that diviſion of years and moneths was alotted by creation and nature from God himſelf, to the Sun and Moon; nor was there ever any other account uſed among the <hi>Chaldaeans</hi> and <hi>Egyptians,</hi> men moſt expert and skilfull in the knowledge of the ſtars.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Chaldaeans</hi> were ſo far from augmenting the numbers, by breaking their years (which they reckoned always by the Sun) by dividing them into monethly and Lunary years, that of thoſe very Solar years they bound up their years into compacted numbers, which they us'd for conveniency of reckoning, and a farr ſhorter way of account. Let them alone then, who e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver uſes ſuch trifling diminutions and diviſions, to make ſuch handfuls and heaps of years, which they neither know, or ever could ſatisfie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in, to this day. However it comes to paſs, it will always appear, that thoſe myriads I ſpoke of will alwayes much exceed, in the leaſt compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, that beginning of the creation which is alwayes ſet down in <hi>Adam.</hi>

Nor did <hi>Solon</hi> reject that jeer of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Prieſt, in which he call'd him and all the Grecians <hi>children</hi> in the knowledge of Hiſtory, he knowing very well, that neither <hi>Solon,</hi> nor any other Grecian, knew any thing of true antiquity.

What ſhall I ſay more of ſo many fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Philoſophers, excellent in learning, who flock'd to thoſe Prieſts, that they might learn the <hi>Egyptian</hi> cuſtoms &amp; knowledg, with ſuch a general opinion of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> learning and prudence? Do we think that thoſe Philoſophers were ſuch blockheads, that they would not have found themſelves groſly gull'd and abus'd in Hiſtories of ſo many thouſand years ago, if they had but ſmelled, or had the leaſt hint that the world was ſo lately made, and only from the time of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam?</hi>

But the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians</hi> wiſdom was the ſame with the <hi>Chaldae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi> for it conſiſted chiefly in Aſtronomy, Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy and Magick: It will be worth while here to conſider, whether or no it was profitable for the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> to gain that exact knowledge of thoſe ſciences which they had in the time of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> in that ſpace which was betwixt the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> and which <hi>Scali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> according to the Jewiſh Greeks, reckoned to be a thouſand nine hundred and eight years; And whether or no the <hi>Egyptians</hi> could perfectly learn thoſe ſciences, as they had them in <hi>Moſes</hi> time, in that thouſand years ſpace which is rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moſes</hi> his writing of <hi>Exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> and which, according to the former Authors is, two thouſand four hundred and fifty three years.</p>
                  <p>They which have the leaſt knowledge in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtronomy, not to ſpeak of thoſe that are perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly skill'd in it, could no otherwiſe have been found out but by knowledge of the earth. For the firſt men by ſeveral experiments obſerv'd that the Inhabitants of the earth in diverſe places, did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habite ſome cold, ſome hot climates; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their ſeveral dwellings, that they had diverſities in their nights, days, and ſeaſons: and that the ſhadows fell contrary to one as to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Nor were theſe obſervations made ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or by chance, but by long and reiterated jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:62635:102"/>by many and wiſe ſearchers of theſe truths. Which after long and grounded experience when they found to be certain and indubitable; from the earth turning towards heaven, they enquir'd from the Sun the cauſes of all theſe vanities, and changes of dayes and nights, Summers and Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. They obſerv'd, that the Sun went out, and return'd to the Aequator, as they call'd it, being confin'd in his courſe by two circles on both ſides, call'd the Tropicks, through a circle which they call'd the Zodiack, which touches the two Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks, but cuts though obliquely the Aequator. And that thoſe Countries which the Sun look'd upon betwixt the Tropicks, his rayes were upon them directly, but his beams more diſtant: from the other, the more diſtant they were from the Tropicks, and nigher to the Poles of heaven. Then were the five Zones found out, and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed. The Torrid Zone, which was under the ſcorching Sun, betwixt the Tropicks; two tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate ones, which being plac'd betwixt the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks and the Poles, enjoy'd a meeker heat. The two cold ones, which from the Polar circles, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vironing the Pole it ſelf, were always benumm'd with ice and cold. There were imagined alſo two Colures, one of the Solſtices, another of the Aequinoxes, the two props of the Sphaere. To theſe the Meridian was added, which ſtanding ſtill when the reſt moved, might be aſſign'd to move, and every motion might have his own Meridian.</p>
                  <p>The Sphaere being thus invented and fram'd, and according to his poſition fitted to the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon;
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:62635:103"/>they obſerved a three-fold Sphaere; a direct, an oblique, and Parallel. In the direct Sphaere they plac'd thoſe that inhabited betwixt the Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quator. In the Parallel, thoſe which were under both Poles. In oblique, thoſe which liv'd in places betwixt the Aequator and either of the Poles. To thoſe that inhabited the direct Sphaere they obſerv'd, that all the Stars did riſe and ſet. But to thoſe that inhabited the oblique Sphaere, ſome did riſe and ſet, others never did ariſe, but remain'd perpetually under the Horizon: that ſome did never ſet, but were continually upon the brink of the Horizon. That in the Parallel Sphaere, none ever did ariſe or ſet, but part of them were alwayes above the Horizon, and part beneath: Unleſſe thoſe, that running through the Zodiack in their courſe, were half ſeen, half unſeen. That thoſe that were in a direct Sphaere, had a perpetual Aequinox. That in the Parallel the day continued for ſix whole moneths, as alſo the night for ſix whole moneths more. That in the oblique Sphaere, there was inequalities both of dayes and nights, according to the elevation of the Sphaere towards either of the Poles. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving alwayes this tenor and temper in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of days and nights, That there was no place upon the earth that had not in the revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of one year, ſix moneths of day, and as many of night; which was apparent to thoſe that inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited the Direct and Parallel Spheres. That in the Oblique, the length of the dayes, and ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the nights in Summer, was recompenſed with the ſhortneſſe of the days, and length of the nights in Winter.</p>
                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:62635:103"/>
                  <p>Beſides, they took notice of the <hi>Perioeci,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiting under the ſame Aequator, in a Parallel Circle under ſeveral Meridians, to whom the days and nights fell out at contrary times, but their Summers and Winters at the ſame time. The <hi>Antoeci,</hi> under ſeveral Parallels, at an equal diſtance on this and th'other ſide of the Aequator, on both ſides at the ſame height of the Meridian, who had their nights and days at the ſame time: but their Summers and Winters at ſeveral ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. The <hi>Antipodes</hi> or <hi>Antichthons,</hi> under parts both aequidiſtant from the Aequator; but plac'd in parts oppoſite of the Meridian; who had their times altogether different, both their Summers and Winters, and their nights and dayes. Took notice likewiſe of the <hi>Amphiſcii,</hi> who had two ſhadows, to the right and left. The <hi>Heteroſcii,</hi> who had but one ſhadow; either to the right or to the left. The <hi>Periſcii,</hi> who had ſhadows about them to all parts of the Horizon.</p>
                  <p>I ſpeak not of a great many things which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the frame of the Sphaere; the heads of which I have but here briefly handled, And which, being long ſince known and publick, may be thought eaſie to be found out, and to need no great pains, to ſuch as take not notice. But if we obſerve well, theſe of them that ſeem the leaſt, could not have been found out, but by long and continual ſearch. Nor could all diſciplines, as they now hang together, have been demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, except Arithmetick and Geometry had firſt been well known by thoſe exquiſite Maſters of Sciences in many ages. In many ages, becauſe
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:62635:104"/>all the Mathematicians, though excellent, found not out all in their own times: Nor could a clear demonſtration of the Sphaere, ſuch as the <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and <hi>Chaldaeans</hi> had, been gained, but ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively, and by experiments and obſervations ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched and gather'd over all the world.</p>

                  <p>BUt whatſoever belongs to the Sphaere, were but Rudiments of that wiſdom and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtronomy, which flouriſh'd chiefly amongſt the <hi>Chaldaeans</hi> and the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> for by ſuch begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings the infirm knowledge of the ſtars firſt was ſtrengthned. For the firſt authors of Aſtronomy, when they gueſſed the motion of the ſtars, They obſerv'd the ſeven Planents plac'd one above ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and innumerable ſix'd and wandring ſtars higher than thoſe Planets, towards the North and the South, diſtinguiſh'd by ſeveral figures of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellations. They obſerv'd likewiſe, that all the ſtars did riſe and ſet diverſly, Aſtronomically, Poetically, Coſmically, with the beginning of the night, or according to the Sun. Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Planets, that they roſe and ſet, now in one place of the Horizon, now in another; and that under the Meridian they did ariſe now high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to the North, now lower to the South, but both within certain bounds. That all went ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more faſt, ſometimes more ſlow; ſeem'd
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:62635:104"/>ſometimes bigger, ſometimes ſlower. Many more are obſerved about the Sun and Moon. That the Sun went thorough the Zodiack, where a line divides it in the middle, which they call the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliptick, dividing the two Hemiſphaeres, the North and the South. That the Sun moves only that way. That the Planets courſes are oblique towards this line, and ſtrayes from it, now to the North, now to the South. That the Moon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in ſeveral Cantons, encreaſing or decreaſing, and that ſhe is in travail and is eclips'd, when ſhe is oppoſite to the Sun, and cuts obliquely the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliptick in either of the oppoſite points, which they call nodes, the head of the Dragon being one, and the tail of the Dragon another. That <hi>Mercury</hi> and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enus</hi> go round the Sun, and are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his followers. That <hi>Mars, Jove,</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,</hi> are not ſo tyed to the Sun, but ſometimes oppoſite to him. That their courſe is ſometimes concentrical, ſometimes excentrical, either high from the earth, or low towards it. Which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times comes to paſſe in Epicycles, ſometimes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, ſometimes retrograde, ſometimes continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But the fixed ſtars kept not alwayes the ſame diſtance from the aequinoctial points, but that in their reaching of them they were exceeding ſlow.</p>
                  <p>To ſalve and explicate theſe appearances, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral grounds were laid, diſputations broach'd of ſome, that ſaid, that the heaven mov'd, and the earth ſtood ſtill: of others, who ſwore the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, that the earth mov'd, and the heaven ſtood ſtill. Affirming, that the ſtars mov'd in very free
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:62635:105"/>diſtances, or bounds, and that their natural mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was from the Eaſt to the Weſt, and thoſe that mov'd more ſlowly to the Weſt ſeem'd to move toward the Eaſt. And others on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary affirm'd, that the ſtars were fixed and plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in ſolid ſphaeres, by whoſe motion they were turn'd about, and together with them did move from the Eaſt to the Weſt. And, to end in few words, ſeveral Theories were aſſign'd to every Planet, found out by long obſervation and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment, which could not have been atchiev'd, but in a very long time and obſervation. They obſerv'd likewiſe various motions of the ſtars, their ſeveral wayes and periods, and diverſe knots of them. That the Planets were diverſly and wonderfully configurate one with another. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold conjunctions of the ſtars. I paſſe by the leſſer. They relate that the conjunction of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi> and <hi>Saturn</hi> in once in Nine hundred years. Of the great Period, at wich time all the ſtars return to their firſt point, enough before. I omit a great many things to the ſame purpoſe; which for fear of diſpleaſure and tediouſneſſe I paſſe by: All which, becauſe they are already publiſh'd, ſeem to people that underſtand not, to have been ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly found out, and without any trouble; but whoſoever ſhall conſider with himſelf, that the moſt ancient and moſt famous Aſtronomers, for the ſpeculations and obſervation of the leaſt of them, dwelt upon mountain tops all their lifes, will not think that they were ſo eaſie, and ſo ſlight to be ſound out. Take notice of that, that as a good King, or a good Poet, is not born every
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:62635:105"/>day: no more were there ſuch Aſtronomers, who, to find them out, would beſtow ſuch care night and day. Therefore it appears, that the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Aſtronomy, of far more large extent than the Sphaere, could not, but in a longer time, and farre more ages, be gained, and found out.</p>

                  <p>BUt although it muſt needs be a vaſt and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>computable time in which thoſe firſt ſearchers beſtow'd their ſtudie in contemplation of the Sphaere &amp; Aſtronomy, their little &amp; of no conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, in compariſon of thoſe in which the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences &amp; natures of the ſtars were found out, &amp; by w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> the ſtrength of the ſtars, both in the motion of the air, &amp; moderating mens fortunes, were found out to have a ſpecial command. The firſt Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomers advanc'd their faces to heaven, to attain to the poſitions and motions of the ſtars. The Aſtrologers who followed them, return'd their eyes from the heaven to the earth, to conſider ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly what the force and influxion of the ſtars, could operate upon the Earth; for they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, that the ſtars had long goads, with which they did punch us from heaven, and that quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were ingendred in men, as their ſtars did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline them.</p>
                  <p>They found by manifold and long experience,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:62635:106"/>that ſome of the ſtars were of a fierie quality, hot, and cholerick; ſome earthly, dry, and melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; ſome ayrie, moiſt, and ſanguine; ſome wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie, moiſt, and phlegmatick. They believ'd, that every Planet had their winds aſſigned to them; and that the courſes, and returns, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and paſſings of ſtars, did foreſhew the times; that ſome of the ſtars were bountifull, ſome ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levolent; thoſe bountifull, which foretold hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe to men; thoſe malevolent, which fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhew'd danger, and were deſtructive to men. That thoſe were mix'd and temperate, which ſometimes made mens lives happy and good, ſometimes unhappy and unproſperous. That ſome ſtars were maſculine, others feminine: ſome Homogeneous, others Heterogeneous. That ſome were happy for the day, ſome for the night. That ſome ſtars by their preſence and teſtimonie wrought; ſome by their rays and aſpect. That they foreſhew'd good or evil, if their preſence were good or bad, their rayes good or evil. That there were deſtroying ſtars, which upon their meeting cut the thred of life. Others Climacte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical, which troubled the courſe of life. That there were heavier or lighter climactericals, and by the meeting of ſome malevolent ſtar became deadly. That the numbers of ſeven and nine was not the cauſe of a Climacterical, but the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree and finiſhing of a ſtar; and that therefore e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Planet had his particular Period, to ſignifie the climacterical returning to the ſame Period e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very year. That there were beſides, trigonal, retragonal, hexagonal, and diameter aſpects. That
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:62635:106"/>the trigons, tetragons and hexagons, ſome were placed on the right hand, ſome on the left: on the right hand, thoſe that wrought by radication and aſpect: on the left, thoſe that wrought by preſence and teſtimonie. In Diameter, were weekly Climactericals, in ninths, or nine dayes in the Tetragon. That benevolent ſtars ſoftned the force of a climacterical ſtar or place; and that the aſpect of a ſtar ſometimes chang'd the aſpect of a ſign. They obſerv'd that the Zodiack had its parts, maſculine and feminine. And as the Aſtronomers divided the Zodiack into twelve ſigns, or parts; the Aſtrologers divided every ſign of the Zodiack into three Decans, and nine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactors or patrons, that divided the twelfth part of the Zodiack into twelve parts, which had the impreſſion of the force of the twelve ſigns, and their names alotted twelve parts in a twelfth ſign in ſigns predominant. Beſides, the antients painted theſe Decans with ſeveral colours. The ſeven Planets, and the twelve Aſteriſms of the Zodiack: thoſe in more flouriſhing colours: the others in darker and obſcurer colours. To <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,</hi> they alotted black: to <hi>Jove,</hi> white: to <hi>Mars,</hi> red: To the Sun, a ſhining colour: to <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> diverſe colours: to <hi>Mercury,</hi> ſand colour: to the <hi>Moon,</hi> an ayrie colour. They thought that a clear ſtar was blunted by a dark one: a dark ſtar enlightned by a clear one; and that ſtars, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixtion of others, receiv'd a hundred colours dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from their own.</p>
                  <p>Alſo, to theſe Decans the Caſters of Nativities attributed the firſt place in all Aſtrologie and
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:62635:107"/>Divination, which ariſes from caſting of Nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Nay, they thought that thoſe Decans were ſo powerful, that there were ſo many people in government, and ſo many univerſal Laws as there were Decans. Hence not only the nativities of Cities, but likewiſe the nativity of the world was eſſayed. But the <hi>Chaldaeans</hi> and the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were moſt acurate in the caſting of Nativities, in the framing of the Dodecatrope, and the Scheme of the Horoſcope; They firſt ſought for the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſcope with all diligence: they found out the Planet of the Nativity, whom they call'd the Lord of the birth, the Prince, and giver of life: then ſought for the Lord of the time, the alotter of his time and fortune. In the erecting of the Scheme, they appointed twelve places, bad and unhappy, according to whoſe determinations or aſpects they gave Judgement: As many they made fortunate or unhappy, in Fortunes dodecatrope, which they ſtyl'd, the twelve rewards of Fortune: and ſo ſtyl'd by the learned <hi>Salmaſius,</hi> not the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of Fortune, as they are commonly call'd. According to the poſition and fabrick of the Scheme, they ordain'd ſtars, who received ſtrength from the Horoſcope, and which mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated every ones Nativity. And although every one of them were of ſufficient force of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; yet for divers aſpects and configurations, by which they were allay'd, they either loſt their forces, or gained new influxions. The Horo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcope was generally with them the ſame which a Decan; but in diviſion, and in their viſibility: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which, the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Chaldaeans</hi> did
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:62635:107"/>caſt Nativities: they enquir'd out the twelve parts of the Horoſcopant ſtar: and not only in what part of the twelve the Horoſcope was, but in what twelfth part of the twelfth part; nay, whether there were any one in the ſixtieth part. And they who were more acurate in their ſearch, whether there were any horoſcope in the ſixtieth part of the ſixtieth, The ſtars ſeem'd well or ill diſpos'd, when the Planets were plac'd in good or bad ſigns, in good or bad parts of them. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, they ordained ſeveral Climactericals, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Horoſcops or Decans. And as to every Decan they aſſign'd their own Planets, they made alſo ſeveral Climactericals, according to the order of the Planets, to be diſpoſed in every na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivity. Nor did they only take notice of the Planets and Decans, in finding out of the Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mactericals; but conſidered likewiſe the aſcenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſtars, and the bounds of every time. All which, by exact and diviſion to the leaſt, were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd out and invented, and accommodated and fitted carefully to their definitive art.</p>
                  <p>They obſerv'd beſides, general Lords of the times, who from the beginning of their lives, to the ends of them, were conſtant companions of their fortunes and actions. Who diſpoſed the times, years, moneths, dayes, and hours, to the following ſtars; and thoſe that follow'd, to thoſe that next them enſued. That the general Lords of the time, receiv'd its times from none, but from its ſelf: But did diſpenſe them to the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Lords of time; and that theſe particular Lords, who receiv'd it of their general, diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:62635:108"/>them likewiſe to their followers: ſo that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſtar had its lordſhip of time in order. That alſo thoſe general Lords had ſpecial ones in their boſoms yearly, monthly, daily, &amp; hourly; in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting of which, and placing them in order, it cannot be ſet down how diligent the antient A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrologers have been, eſpecially in the giving and receiving of time which the ſtars ſubſtitute to another, did borrow from one another. They obſerv'd that ſtars did alter and change from good to evil, and that one Lord of time did not confer good or evil, but many; and when good or bad at one time happen'd to one man, theſe contrarieties could not have been foreſeen from one Lord, but many: For as the aſpects of the ſtars, their courſes, circulations, and meetings, were mix'd: ſo were mens actions and fortunes mix'd upon earth.</p>
                  <p>Several things beſides were obſerv'd of this kind, which are common with the Maſters of this Science. And a great many more things, which by the antiquity and malice of time are bereft us, and loſt with the books of the <hi>Chaldae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and <hi>Egyptians.</hi> Of which, if they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, we would, perhaps, ſee what <hi>Pſellus</hi> hath written of the Books of <hi>Teucer</hi> of <hi>Babylon. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>reads them, ſhall find many things in them wonderful, of the Celeſtial ſigns and Decans, which ariſe with them, which have influence on ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral actions and events.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I confeſſe, that all theſe things, and all matters of Nativity, conſiſted of wandring and arbitrary principles, but being various, and ſo often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iterated,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:62635:108"/>for that very ſame reaſon were to be found out by obſervation and experiment. And for that cauſe, muſt needs have been a perfecting through a great many ages. For which canſe the antient tradition of them was in ſuch repute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the antients, that it had Patrons, both Gods, Heroes, and men: <hi>Mercurius, Aeſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapius, Anubius, Petoſiris, Necepſon, Orpheus,</hi> and a great many more who have written Aphoriſms concerning the determinations of the ſtars, and who have thought that ſomething, which wee think idle ſtories, and have added weight to this ſmoke.</p>
                  <p>Which things ſo often as I conſider with my ſelf, I wonder no longer at ſo many Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years, which <hi>Cicero</hi> ſayes the <hi>Chaldaeans</hi> ſet down in trying of Children according to their Nativities. Hence that ſcrupulous care amongſt the ancient Caſters of Nativities, in finding out the partile Horoſcope, in diſtributing the lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips of time among the ſtars, in ſearching out the Climactericals.

                  <head type="sub">Of the antiquity of the Divinity and Magick of the Gentiles.</head>
                  <p>THat the Divinitie of the Gentiles was an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to that moſt ancient and firſt Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, none can deny. For the firſt men ſtrayed a great while upon earth, before they turn'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards heaven, and gaind from the dimenſions of the earth, the dimenſions of heaven. Aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, who ſucceeded them, ſtray'd long in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in finding out the courſes of the ſtars. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrologers, who followed them, look'd long down upon the earth, to find out by diligent conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, what power the ſtars had upon earth. The Divines, who were the Diſciples of the Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, turn'd their eyes back again upon heaven, and when they ſaw thoſe celeſtial fires as it were pierce our inferiour bodies with their rayes, for which cauſe the Bible calls them <hi>the hoſt of heaven,</hi> they thought them to be Gods omnipotent, to whom all things did give obedience, and turn'd all things towards themſelves; and ſo gave them names, either from the power they exerciſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earthly things, or from ſome peculiar effect that they had in mens deſtinies.</p>
                  <p>They attributed to the world its God, or geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, whom before I did ſhew at large to have been the Prince of the inferiour Gods, and a ſpirit of the firſt creation; They call'd him <hi>Pan,</hi> and gave to him a whiſtle of ſeven reeds; at the ſound of
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:62635:109"/>which, all the reſt of the <hi>Satires</hi> and <hi>Pans</hi> did dance; ſignifying, that that univerſal ſpirit and God, did move and moderate all the reſt, by the harmony and conſent of the ſeven Plants. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, they aſſign'd to particular places, towns, peoples, houſes, their own Genius. All which, becauſe they are tedious, and known to moſt, I paſſe.</p>
                  <p>But likewiſe becauſe moſt men did referr the beginnings and cauſes of things, not only to ſtars, but to ſuperceleſtial intelligences, and to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the world: many things were ſpoken of gods and their degrees; which contentions <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> of <hi>Egypt</hi> to compoſe, call'd by them <hi>Triſme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistus,</hi> and eſteem'd a God, perform'd a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thing, as <hi>Firmicus</hi> relates, <hi>Mercury of Egypt,</hi> ſays he, <hi>wrote twenty thouſand volumes of divers ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and beginnings of degrees of celeſtial powers, which were diverſly related. In which the Aſtrologie and Divinity of the Egyptians was explained. Which arts he had taught</hi> Aeſculapius <hi>and</hi> Anubius. The which, that it may be confirm'd by good au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, <hi>Iamblichus</hi> relates this of thoſe bookes in his Mercurials: <hi>Mercury,</hi> ſays he, <hi>made twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thouſand books, as</hi> Meneteus <hi>ſays; yea thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, threeſcore thouſand, five hundred and twenty five books. He wrote a hundred books of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyrean Gods, as many of the ethereal, a thouſand of the selestial.</hi> Hence we may gueſſe how excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding antient the Theologie of the Gentiles was, both by the Antiquitie of <hi>Mercury</hi> himſelf: as alſo from the firſt authors of the Theologie of the Gentiles, who, long before <hi>Mercury,</hi> could not
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:62635:110"/>agree concerning their own Gods. Hence it is alſo manifeſt, that the Theologie of the Gentils flow'd fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the knowledg of the ſtars; becauſe whatſoever fables the Gentils did invent concerning their own Gods, were underſtood of the influences of the Planets, their aſpects and conjunctions. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they feign'd, that <hi>Saturn</hi> was harſh and cruel, becauſe the appearance of that ſtar in heaven was malignant and hurtfull. That <hi>Jove</hi> was given to love, becauſe his ſtar was bountifull, and exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larated mens hearts. That <hi>Mars</hi> being fierce and bloodie, was mollified by the intervening of <hi>Venus.</hi> That their conjunction was hinder'd by the Sun. And the reſt, which in relating I ſhould be troubleſom.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, the Theologie of the Gentiles begot their Magick; and thoſe which were the Prieſts of their Gods, were alſo their Magicians. The Antients thorght there were hidden vertues in all things terreſtrial, either by a divine ray, or a vertue ſo diſpoſing them, or infus'd by intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, by ways of mediate, or impreſs'd in them in the creation by primitive copies. That like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe all things terreſtrial were in heaven in a ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial and pure form, in the intelligences more ſimply and intellectually, in the primitive copies purely, and in manner of Idea's. And that all things, by divine attraction, and ſymbolical love, were reciprocable, and by mutual breathings fed one upon another. That things celeſtial and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceleſtial, by their influxions did draw things terreſtrial towards them. That things terreſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al likewiſe by their appetites drew down things
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:62635:110"/>celeſtial to them. And for this reaſon, that there was no growing thing in the earth but had its proper ſtar, by whoſe ſpirit it poſſeſſeth both life and ſtrength, and thoſe faculties with which it was indued. Not to ſpeak of ſtones, metals, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſtones, trees, beaſts, and men, to whom they likewiſe appointed their own ſtars. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with ſuch efficacious things they were thought to work wonders, preparing them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Moon, Star, or the Aſpect. For, as the vertue operative from things occult produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced things manifeſt: ſo theſe Magicians, by the help of things manifeſt, ſeem'd to produce hidden effects by the influxion; of ſtars, and things natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſympathizing with the celeſtial. And ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd, that the celeſtial influxions, mix'd with the power of things natural, produc'd effects ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable here on earth, though the cauſes of them were in heaven.</p>
                  <p>Hence it is that they relate that the ſhapes of ſtars and gods have by enchantments been call'd down, and the Gods themſelves forc'd by their charms, by ſacrifice, conſecrations, incenſe, invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations and imprecatious. Thoſe forms of gods and ſtars they call'd perſons and preſences, ſuch as the Decans were. For Decan, according to the <hi>Chaldee</hi> and <hi>Perſian,</hi> as the ſame <hi>Salmaſius</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, was a preſence or appearance. Theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſences or appearances ſomtimes were proſperous, ſom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<q>
                        <l>The direful ſhapes and Gods that ruin'd <hi>Troy,</hi>
                        </l>
                        <l>Preſent themſelves.</l>

                     <pb n="196" facs="tcp:62635:111"/>In ſacrificing they appear'd either hoſtile or friendly. For the depulſion of hoſtile appearances, the Purple tyre of the head was appointed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> as <hi>Trojan Helenus</hi> ordain'd <hi>A Eneas:</hi> Aeneid. 3.
<q>
                        <l>With purple vail thy ſight and head attire,</l>
                        <l>Leaſt at the ſacrifice and holy fire,</l>
                        <l>Some direfull interrupting ſhape thou ſee.</l>
                        <l>Which after muſt a ſolemn cuſtom be,</l>
                        <l>To thee, thy friends, and thy poſterity.</l>
                     </q> From thoſe inchantments all witchcrafts and Philtres took their beginnings, by which men were either bewitched to love or hatred, or made well or ill. To this adde the impreſſions either of good or bad virtues, in thoſe Images, which they call <hi>Taliſmanical,</hi> by characters, adjuration, lights, ſounds, numbers, words, and names. For they thought that Nature expreſs'd hidden effects in like ſhapes, as it were by ſympathie, and that the Gods expreſs'd the truth of Ideas by manifeſt Images. As alſo the antient Prieſts of ſeveral things compoſing one thing, liken'd it to that one thing, which is above many things. The ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which compoſition would weaken every one of the materials, but the mixtion of them by exemplary force reſtore the Idea. They relate, that the Decans in thoſe Taliſmanical figures were uſed to be painted, one with an ax, another with a dart, another with a head of a man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, with rayes about it, and that the images of them were graven upon the ſtones of rings for
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:62635:111"/>charms. And that they thought there was a great deal of force in thoſe Taliſmans, if they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrations graven in them in the <hi>Chaldee</hi> or <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> tongue, thoſe being the tongues of antient Nations.</p>
                  <p>What ſhall I ſpeak of thoſe Magical words breath'd upon things enchanted, which fitted them for the ſuſception of any vertue the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian pleaſed, beſides the ordinary cuſtom, and that being ſpoke backward would cauſe unuſual effects? Is it not ordinary, that by the force of Magick it has thundred, without the knowledge of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> rivers turn'd back, the Seas ſtaid, the Sun ſtopt, the Moon clear'd, the ſtars pull'd down, the jaws of Vipers broken, and the heads of Aſps by charms ſplit in pieces? What ſhall I ſpeak of the River of Hell turn'd back, Ghoſts call'd up, mens ſhapes chang'd, the courſe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture interrupted, and the whole world aſtoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed?</p>
                  <p>Beſides, there were ſeveral ways of Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtication, by Aſtrological and Magical inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by Phyſiognomic, by Metopoſcopic, by Chiromancie, Geomancie, Hydromancie, Aero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancie, Pyromancie, by ſacrifice, thunder, lightning, by dreams, by apparitions, after long waking, by ſurie and madneſſe, after watching; in all which things there were predictions of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture things.</p>
                  <p>It is not my deſire that all theſe things which I have declar'd, ſhould be believ'd. But that it may, appear that the leaſt part of Magick and Divination had its arts found out by manifold
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:62635:112"/>obſervation and long experience; and thoſe not frivolous and vain, but of ſuch weight and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that they were next to miracles. Such as were to turn rods into Serpents: to change the waters of the river into bloud: and to bring up Frogs; Which were not meerly the coſenage of the Devil, but the mighty and wonderful pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Magick. Which Magick St. <hi>Stephen</hi> in the 7th of the <hi>Acts</hi> calls <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> and which <hi>Moſes</hi> was chiefly skill'd in, according to the <hi>Hebrew.</hi> Writers themſelves, and not only in that, <hi>but all the w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But if the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were ſo skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in Magick, according to the Scripture; as alſo the <hi>Chaldaeans,</hi> who in this did contend with them, How skillful muſt we think them in Aſtrology, Aſtronomy, and the Sphaere? Yea, if they were skillful in many things of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick in this age unknown, Why ſhould not we think they knew many things in Aſtrology, Aſtronomy, and the Sphere, which we know not? And if they knew more in thoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplines, Why ſhould not wee think that they beſtowed more time in the learning of them?</p>
                  <p>To theſe let there be added many other Arts and Sciences, depending and adherent to theſe, which whoſoever knows, muſt be thought to have learn'd the other. And let us ſeriouſly conſider whether or no (which we undertook to demonſtrate) the <hi>Chaldaeans</hi> and <hi>Egyptians</hi>
                     <pb n="199" facs="tcp:62635:112"/>could learn all thoſe Sciences, which is betwixt <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> the <hi>Chaldaean,</hi> or <hi>Moſes</hi> the <hi>Egyptian.</hi> Certainly, if we doe this freely and with clear intentions, there is none but will think this time exceeding narrow to have found out the moſt trivial experiments of Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; not to ſpeak of the higheſt, ſuch as were A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtronomy, Aſtrologie, and Magick, curiouſly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, weigh'd, and demonſtrated.</p>

Let thoſe famous perſons pardon me, if I tell them, that they doe not ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:62635:113"/>conſider what they ſay. <hi>Adam,</hi> as we ſaid before, being made perfect, had in him all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections belonging to a man, but notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding gain'd nothing by that perfection, which might exceed that perfection and his own huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: But <hi>Adam</hi> had exceeded the perfection of all humanitie, if that day he was made he had perfectly known all arts and ſciences. Therefore he underſtood them not. Let us grant, that the world was made with <hi>Adam,</hi> it will not therefore follow, that all ſciences and arts were fram'd with <hi>Adam.</hi> Truly, in the beginning the prime cauſes and means of all ſciences were in God, but the ſeeds of them were only ſowed in <hi>Adam,</hi> which could not ariſe, but by meditation, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning with himſelf, by cultivating, and time. <hi>Adam</hi> might attain all arts and ſciences; but not for that cauſe he attained to them that minute he was born. Beſides, <hi>Adam</hi> could not underſtand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing of things paſt, or judge of things to come, as a man, though moſt perfect, unleſſe by know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or conjecture, or rather by conſideration of things preſent, according to the common phraſe, that there can be nothing in the knowledge or intellect of the moſt perfect man, which is not firſt his ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>For Example then. <hi>Adam</hi> could not ſubdivide the regions of heaven, which is the knowledge of the Sphere, but that he firſt muſt find out the regions of the earth, unleſſe he had firſt travel'd about the world, and view'd it. But ſuch a thing could not be perform'd, but by daily jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, meditation, and comparing, according to

                  <p>But if <hi>Adam,</hi> as a man; yea in the integrity of his perfection, or before ſin, which is the ſame thing, could not but by little and little, and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of time, gain all ſciences, arts, and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plines: Certainly he muſt be far longer time in gaining them after his fall; eſpecially according to their ſuppoſition, who think, that his mine was darkned and dulld by ignorance of all things.

<pb n="203" facs="tcp:62635:114"/>there is as much in the Bible, as God has grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us to know, either of the Original of the World, of Prophecies, Divine myſteries, or our ſalvation. Thoſe things which belong meerly to our Salvation, conſiſt but in a few things. And in them the holy Spirit has beſtow'd ſo much pains and clearneſſe, as belongs to humane capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. Thoſe things which concern other things are ſet down more at large. And concerning them, I ſhall openly declare that which all know, but moſt are loath to ſpeak, That ſo great things are written with ſo great careleſsneſs and obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, that ſometimes nothing can be more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, nothing more intricate.</p>
                  <p>Seeking with my ſelf what ſhould be the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this, I anſwered thus in reaſon to my ſelf, as any one would have done, That God, who would have himſelf known by men, hid himſelf, and would not be perfectly ſeen. For that he profeſſed concerning himſelf to the Jews, <hi>That he would dwell in a cloud.</hi> And therefore in the Old Teſtament open'd himſelf unto them not always under one name. And in the Goſpel hinder'd the Devils and the Spirits from divulging who he was.

                  <p>We read alſo in the 2. of <hi>Deuteronomy, The</hi> Horraeans <hi>firſt dwelt in</hi> Seir: <hi>whom the children of</hi> Eſau <hi>driving out, dwelt there, as</hi> Iſrael <hi>did in the Land of his poſſeſsion, which the Lord gave him.</hi> In theſe words it is ſaid, That the <hi>Idumeans,</hi> who are the Sons of <hi>Eſau,</hi> inhabited Mount <hi>Seir,</hi> driving out the Inhabitants of thoſe Mountains, And that the Jews again inhabited this Mount <hi>Seir,</hi> and gain'd Mount <hi>Seir</hi> as a poſſeſſion, driving out and deſtroying thoſe <hi>Idumaeans.</hi> Yet it is moſt certain, that the <hi>Idumaeans,</hi> according to <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf, were not thrown out in his time, as it is in <hi>Deutronomy</hi> in the ſame Chapter. <hi>And the Lord ſaid to me,</hi> ſaith <hi>Moſes, You ſhall paſs through the confines of your brethren the ſons of</hi> Eſau, <hi>who dwell in</hi> Seir, <hi>and they ſhall be afraid of you; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take heed you move not againſt them, for I will not give you of their Land one foot; for I have given Mount</hi> Seir <hi>in poſſeſsion to</hi> Eſau.

But let God be to me as much hid as he will. It is nothing to me, Why God did it, ſince I know he did it. I cannot pierce that cloud with my eyes wherein God dwells, but know certainly that God dwells in a cloud. And in the cloud I worſhip him. I am not able by that clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which I have, if any ſuch there be, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten thoſe obſcure things in the Scriptures, which we read daily; to order all thoſe things which are conſus'd and undigeſted; to recall thoſe things which have been ſlipt; to reſtore things that are wanting, or reconcile things that are contrary; nor to have full knowledge of the beginning of the world, by reading of them; nor diſtinguiſh the order of the holy Scripture; nor perfectly underſtand the Prophets; nor perfectly know the efficacie of myſteries.

Yea, you will ſay, it is eaſie to diſcern the cockle from the wheat, the chaff from the grain, the gold from the ſilver, the hay from the ſtubble. But what wit ſo clear can we have, who can diſtinguiſh the primitive copy from the ſecond copy? A copy, I ſay, ſo near to the original, that, according to your own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, he ſhall mock your skill in the ſeveral ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudes of phraſes. And yet truly it is not very hard to diſtinguiſh the true copy from the other, where the author confeſſes out of what books he took it. The difficulty is, to know what are the words of the Copier, and which are the real words of the Original. And to ſpeak the very truth, it is impoſſible to know all theſe things. Many things indeed there are, that if one take good heed, you ſhall find which are the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, which the Copy.

                  <p>Truly I think that <hi>Moſes,</hi> whoſe end it was to write chiefly his own Hiſtory, and the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the times wherin he liv'd, wrote very briefly all the things which were before his own time; eſpecially ſuch things as concern'd the firſt crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion And thoſe which were the gatherers of Copies, touch'd a great deal more briefly the heads of the Jews, and the univerſal creation. And hence I think it has come to paſſe, that the creation of the world is ended in one, in the firſt Chapter of <hi>Geneſis;</hi> and that afterward, the fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of <hi>Adam,</hi> and building of <hi>Eve,</hi> are a little more particularly ſet down, and that after all that time which was betwixt <hi>Cam</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> is run over in the 4. and 5. Chap. Let any reaſonable man judge, whether or no in thoſe 4 and 5 Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which are very ſhort, and full of Genealo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, all could be comprehended which was act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or invented upon the face of the earth for a thouſand ſix hundred yeares and more? And whether in any reaſon we can deny ſuch things, as without violation of Myſteries of Faith, by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and right demonſtrations can be made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, only for this cauſe, becauſe theſe two ſhort Chapters make no mention of them.</p>
                  <p>Thus I ſeriouſly conſidering, and diligently weighing all thoſe things, which I at large have ſpoken concerning thoſe moſt antient times, both out of prophane and ſacred hiſtory: as alſo, which I ſhall ſpeak hereafter of, that Eternal age ſince which the world is ſaid to have been fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, by the Prophets and Apoſtles. I doubted not to recall the creation of the firſt men to the
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:62635:121"/>beginnings of things, long before <hi>Adams</hi> time. Nor does it trouble me, that <hi>Geneſis</hi> makes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ly denyed ſuch men. Yet, although <hi>Geneſis</hi> have ſo briefly, nothing more brief, gone over the originals of things, yet we may gather from the ſame book, that the creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the firſt men was far different, which is hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at in the firſt Chapter, from the faſhioning of <hi>Adam,</hi> the firſt father of the Jews; which is more largely ſet down in the ſecond Chapter.</p>
                  <p>They argue ordinarily. We hear no men na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med before <hi>Adam</hi> in <hi>Geneſis;</hi> Therefore there were none before <hi>Adam.</hi> And yet we deny that, that there was no men before <hi>Adam,</hi> becauſe there are none nam'd in <hi>Geneſ's.</hi> For it is well known, that all things are nor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

On the ſame account they affirm, that the Ark of <hi>Noah</hi> was the firſt of all ſhips; becauſe we read of never another in <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis.</hi> As if <hi>Adam,</hi> who according to their ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, was taught all arts at his making, ſhould have been ignorant of Navigation, the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent of all arts, and moſt neceſſarie for the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie of men.

                  </p>
                  <p>But they talk of a Man-monſter, not of a man, who think that <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> was really with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Father or Mother, or without Original, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther having any beginning of dayes, nor end of life, only for that reaſon, becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> in no place makes mention either of the Parents, birth, or death of <hi>Melchiſedech.</hi> They doe not mind that which <hi>Iohn Cameron,</hi> a moſt learned and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute Divine has obſerv'd, That theſe things were by <hi>Moſes</hi> myſtically paſs'd over, and myſtical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerv'd by <hi>Moſes,</hi> to ſhew that the Prieſthood of <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> was eternal, according to the Prieſthood of Chriſt; not temporal, like the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal and Moſaical Prieſthood, which begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from Fathers, begat ſonnes in the ſame order; and taking its riſe from <hi>Moſes,</hi> ended in Chriſt. But <hi>Melchiſedech</hi>'s Prieſthood nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther came from the Fathers of it, which were Prieſts, nor was deriv'd upon the Sons which were Prieſts; but ſuch a one it was, as had no known beginning, and was like to have no known ending. Reaſon and Faith perſwade us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand theſe things ſo, leaſt the myſterie of ſilence ſhould pervert the order of nature; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which, <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> who had both Father and Mother, might naturally beget chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and naturally have an original, and an end.

<pb n="218" facs="tcp:62635:122"/>
                     <hi>Geneſis;</hi> theſe agree with Faith and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. And theſe things ſhow, that <hi>Geneſis</hi> wrote myſteries, not monſtrous things. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe things are ſo; becauſe ſo to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood.</p>
                  <p>And with like negligence they believe that there was no men before <hi>Adam,</hi> becauſe there is none before him read of in <hi>Moſes.</hi> Nor is it taken notice of, that the deſign of <hi>Moſes</hi> in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down <hi>Adam,</hi> was not to mention the firſt of mankinde, but the Father of the Jews, whoſe peculiar Hiſtorie he wrote, and not the Hiſtory of all Nations. Truly the beginning of the Jews in <hi>Moſes,</hi> and in <hi>Joſephus</hi> both, is with <hi>Adam.</hi> After that, <hi>Moſes</hi> has told us the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of men, and of the Gentiles, in the firſt Chapter, with the beginning of the world; and has ſet down the Gentiles different in ſtock and original from the Jews.

The darkneſs at the death of our Saviour, was over the whole Land of the Jews, not over all the world. The Star which appear'd to the Wiſe men, was a ſtream of light in the ayr, not a ſtar in heaven.</head>
                  <p>THere is great errour in reading the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture many times, when that is taken more more generally, which ought to be particularly underſtood: as that of <hi>Adam,</hi> whom <hi>Moſes</hi> made firſt Father of the Jews, and whom we hyberbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lically call the firſt Father of all men.</p>
                  <p>That which is believ'd of the darkneſſe in the death of our Saviour, is of the ſame ſtrain. For the Divines think, that this darkneſſe was ſpred over the face of all the earth; Becauſe all the Evangeliſts agree with one conſent, that they were upon <hi>the whole earth.</hi> Which notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the better Interpreters have tranſlated, <hi>upon all the Land of the Jews;</hi> according to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews, ſay they, which for the earth, mean <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtine.</hi> Nor was the miracle without a myſterie; for there had been a time when dark night cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all the Land of <hi>Egypt</hi> at the command of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> but all the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had light in their dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings. Now was the day come, at the death of Chriſt, when the light of the Goſpel ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to the Gentiles; and all the Land of the
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:62635:123"/>Jews, and the Jews themſelves, ſhould be o'r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt with the darkneſſe of incredulity.</p>
                  <p>Here let us ſpeak of the Star which appear'd to the wiſe men, on the Nativity of our Lord, which it is common and ordinary to place in heaven, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt of the Stars: which that it never was, nor ever could be, is made appear thus. All other men on the earth had ſeen it, as well as the wiſe men. <hi>Herod</hi> had ſeen it among the reſt, being troubled at this report, whom this appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance did more eſpecially concern; But <hi>Herod</hi> neither ſaw it, nor could ſee it: for <hi>calling the wiſe men privately,</hi> ſayes the <hi>Evangelist, he enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of them, what time the star did appear?</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is clear, it was neither a Star in heaven, nor viſible to all, as is commonly believ'd; but that Star, that fire, did only ſhine to the wiſe men, that by the guiding of it they might arrive at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and which thoſe wiſe men did fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, as a torch, that they might worſhip the King of the Jews; nor did it appear to <hi>Herod,</hi> nor any of the reſt. Such was that fierie army ſent to the help of <hi>Eliſha</hi> from heaven, whom the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſaw, and yet his Servant that ſtood by him, could not ſee: ſuch another miracle, though dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent in the <hi>ſpecies</hi> of it; for one man did not ſee thoſe fires innumerable which <hi>Eliſha</hi> ſaw: The three wiſe men ſaw one Star, which a great many men could not ſee.</p>
                  <p>It appears out of the Goſpel it ſelf, that that Star was not fix'd in heaven, from theſe words, <hi>Behold a star went before them, and ſtood above the place where the child was.</hi> But if that Star had bin
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:62635:123"/>in heaven, how could it ſtand above the place where the child was? or how could the wiſe men draw a perpendicular line from the point of that Star upon the houſe? The wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e men might have diſcern'd to what Countrey that region of the heaven, where in that Star was, did anſwer; But to know that ſmall place, that manger, in which the child lay, could not be done by ſeeing, by any count or wit of man. Therefore it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that Star, or that light or fire, as I may call it, as it is written in the 8. of the <hi>Apocalyps, It fell from heaven, burning like a lamp.</hi> I ſay it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that lamp from heaven which lighted the <hi>Magi,</hi> was ſent from heaven for their particular uſe, after which the <hi>Magi</hi> ſhould walk, and which ſtanding ſtill above the place where the Child lay, they ſhould likewiſe ſtand ſtill, and adore that Jeſus Chriſt whom they ſought for. Such was that cloud, like a white one in the day-time, and fierie in the night; which no man will ſay was an apparition in the whole Hemiſphaere; for it was particularly over the Jews camp, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly covered the holy Tabernacle; They marched according to the particular motion of that cloud, and ſtood ſtill when it ſtood ſtill; as we muſt likewiſe believe the wiſe men did with their Star.</p>
                  <p>As alſo, if that Star had been fix'd in heaven, it had gon before others alſo who journeyed from the Eaſt to the Weſt, which is not written; yea, only that it went before the <hi>Magi.</hi> It would likewiſe have run according to the account and courſe of other Stars which are about the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:62635:124"/>from the Eaſt to the Weſt; But who could have followed it with like ſwiftneſſe? Laſtly, if this Star had been placed in ſight, all famous Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians would have ſpoken of it, who wrote the memorable things of their own times and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, which none did.</p>
                  <p>Therefore it is ſufficiently prov'd, that moſt, thought not the wiſeſt Interpreters, erre, who think that that Star appear'd to all men in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which appear'd indeed to the wiſe men onely, onely to three men, as is written. They erre, I ſay, becauſe they underſtand that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally of a Star, which ought to be particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly underſtood of a light, or a burning flame.</p>

                  <p>THat which I ſhall ſpeak of the miracle which God did in curing <hi>Ezechiah,</hi> being ſick, is leſſe common, of greater concernment, as it is in the <hi>Kings,</hi> Book 2.

And God brought back the ſhadow by thoſe lines that it had gone down in the Dyal of</hi> Achaz, <hi>back ten degrees.</hi> Which is written in <hi>Eſay,</hi> ch. 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. in theſe words, <hi>Behold I will make the ſhadow
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:62635:124"/>of the lines by which it is gone down in the Dyal of</hi> Achaz, <hi>to return in the Sun. And the Sun returned ten lines by the degrees that it had gone down.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this miracle it is received as current, that the Sun went back in the heaven. For the miracle which was only in the Dyal of <hi>Achaz,</hi> is put in the Sun and the heaven, and becauſe the ſhadow is brought back in the Dyal, the Sun muſt needs go back in Heaven; nor could God make a miracle in the Dyal of <hi>Achaz,</hi> but with a violent moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he muſt turn the whole heaven, and diſturb the moſt general frame. This is to fool one with that fine ſport, as if one would cauſe remove the chimney and the fire from him, that he might not be burnt, rather let him goe back himſelf, and let the fire ſtand ſtill, leſt the houſe be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermined by the removing of the chimney. Let the miracle be plac'd in the Dyal, as is the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Scripture, and then the miracle will be in its own place: Nature will ſtand in its own frame, and mens intellects will not be fool'd with vain jugglings. For, good God, what a miſtake is this, that has befool'd a great many wiſe men, that they believed that the Sun had gone back.</p>
                  <p>If the Sun went back, either he went back in the Zodiack, or that degree of the Ecliptick ſtanding ſtill, which he was running that day; the <hi>primum mobile</hi> came backward, and with the <hi>primum mobile</hi> all the reſt of the Sphaeres; amongſt which the Sun was likewiſe turn'd back. If we ſay that he went back only in the Zodiack, and a tenth part of the Zodiack, according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:62635:125"/>he is ſaid to have gone back in the Dyal of <hi>Achaz,</hi> the Sun muſt needs return through a great many ſigns of the Zodiack, and return paſſ'd moneths, yea ſeaſons of the year, which were paſt in the minute of one hour; which were an horrid confuſion and abſurdity. But how much are they gone backward, not to ſay from truth, or from any probable conjecture, who think that the whole heavens went back, that the ſhadow of the Dyal might goe back? That were to diſturb all nature, to make a difference in the tenour and order of all things, to confuſe the riſing and ſetting of ſtars, to deſtroy all Ephemerides, and Aſtronomical tables, and to make a confuſion in all Aſtronomy. But who ever heard of any ſuch confuſion? who ever heard of this back <hi>ſuperſant?</hi> for the memory of things which paſt in the days of <hi>Ezechiah,</hi> is yet extant among the Gentiles.</p>
                  <p>But why ſhould there be a greater miracle in the ſickneſſe of <hi>Ezechiah,</hi> than in the death of the Lord. There was darkneſſe only about <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in the death of the Lord, and ſhould the Sun ſhine longer to the world, in the ſickneſſe of <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiah;</hi> Chriſt died, <hi>Ezechiah</hi> was only ſick; Chriſt in his death was perfecting the redemption of the World, <hi>Ezechiahs</hi> ſickneſſe only concern'd himſelf and his people: How ill ſuch compari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The laſt period of a mans life, and of his Dyal, is called the laſt hour. Again the life of
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:62635:125"/>the King is well compared to a Kingly Dyal. The ſhadow went back, which was deſcending in the Dyal which <hi>Achaz</hi> had made. The life of <hi>Ezech<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> who was dying, whom <hi>Achaz</hi> had begotten, went backward likewiſe, nor could <hi>Ezechias</hi> have any more convenient ſign of his recovery than this miracle, which therefore was given as a particular ſign to <hi>Ezechias, Chron.</hi> 2. <hi>chap.</hi> 32. Ezechias <hi>was ſick unto death, and God gave him a ſign,</hi> he gave it to him, not to all. And this ſign was ſeen in the land of <hi>Iudah,</hi> not in all lands, which is to be obſerved &amp; is proved by the ſame place of the <hi>Chron.</hi> That their was Ambaſſadors ſent from <hi>Babilon,</hi> who came to enquire of the ſign which had happened, not in the heaven, which take notice of, but upon the earth, meaning the land of <hi>Iudah:</hi> Nor had the Babilonians needed to have enquired of the <hi>Iews</hi> concerning the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, if it had happened in <hi>Babilon,</hi> or if the Sun had gone back in the Firmament, for they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves had ſeen it.</p>
                  <p>Therefore this miracle muſt be reduced to the Dyal of <hi>Achaz;</hi> yea the holy Scripture ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly meaned ſo, and directly ſets it down in both places of <hi>Eſay</hi> and of the <hi>Kings,</hi> if the words of both places be well weigh'd as is fit. The words in <hi>Kings</hi> are theſe. <hi>The Lord brought back the ſhadow by the lines by which it had gone down in the Dyal of</hi> Achaz. Obſerve here, that the miracle is expreſly ſignified in the Dyal of <hi>Achaz.</hi> The words of <hi>Iſay</hi> are. <hi>And the Sun returned ten lines by the degrees it had gone downe</hi> In theſe places <hi>the bringing back of the ſhadow and</hi>
                     <pb n="226" facs="tcp:62635:126"/>the Sun, are the ſame; becauſe the ſhadow could not return, unleſſe the Sun returned: nor the Sun return, but the ſhadow muſt return. And that is it which <hi>Eſay</hi> ſays in the words immediatly before, <hi>Behold, I will make the ſhadow of the lines re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, by which it is gone down in the dyal of</hi> Achaz, <hi>in the Sun;</hi> or with the Sun, which is the ſame. The Sun is not there taken for the Sun it ſelf, but for the light which it throws upon any ſuperfice whereon it ſhines: which it throws upon all dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, and ſuch a one as you may believe it caſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the dyal of <hi>Achaz.</hi> Moreover, thoſe lines of which the <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Iſaiah</hi> here ſpeak, were drawn out upon the dyal of <hi>Achaz,</hi> according to the ſhadow of the Gnomon, which, according to art, is plac'd in the middle of the dyal.

Nor can I call thoſe preciſely ſhadows, or preciſely the Sun; but rather the extremities, or individual diſtinctions of the Sun and ſhadow; for in them the laſt part of the Sun is the firſt of the ſhadow, but the laſt of the ſhadow is not the

                  <p>LEt us try if any ſuch thing may be underſtood in the miracle of <hi>Joſhua, in whoſe wrath the Sun was ſtop'd,</hi> Ecclus. Chap. 20. As alſo, <hi>ſtood ſtil, and obey'd the voice of a man,</hi> Joſhua 10. God had rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the <hi>Amorrhites</hi> before <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who being bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten from the top of <hi>Gabaon</hi> to the deſcents of <hi>Bethoron,</hi> ſought for ſhelter in the valleys; <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua</hi> was reſolv'd to deſtroy them utterly, whom leaſt the night ſhould reſcue from his ſword and revenge, he ſaid in the ſight of <hi>Iſrael, Thou Sun ſtirr not from</hi> Gabaon, <hi>nor thou Moon from the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of</hi> Ajalon: <hi>And the Sun &amp; Moon ſtood ſtil, til the people had reveng'd themſelves on their enemies.</hi> And in the ſame place, <hi>The Sun ſtood ſtill for the ſpace of a whole day, and made no hast to go down.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is none, but upon the firſt ſight of theſe words will affirm, that the Sun ſtood ſtill in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; But if any one weigh more attentively the force of the miracle, and contain the miracle within its own bounds, he ſhall eaſily find, that the light and rayes of the Sun are underſtood, not the Sun it ſelf. It gives us boldneſſe to conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture ſo, becauſe it is ſaid, <hi>That the Sun ſtood ſtill in the midſt of heaven;</hi> For the Sun was then go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down, when <hi>Joſhua</hi> bid it ſtand ſtill. Nor could the Sun then ſtand in the middle of heaven,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:62635:128"/>where he was not; for the going down of the Sun is diſtant from the middle of the heaven a whole Quadrant: Therefore this miracle is ſo to be underſtood, That when the Sun was really going down, the light of the Sun, without the Sun it ſelf, by a great miracle remain'd as yet in the Atmoſphaere, or region of vapours, which is over the middle of the air, and the skie. And that light of the Sun, without the Sun it ſelf, did beat upon the City of <hi>Gabaon,</hi> and the mountain of <hi>Gabaon,</hi> ſo that thoſe rayes which came from that light, being reverberated from that moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, ſhone through all the valley: inſomuch as the <hi>Amorrhites</hi> who fled, could not eſchew <hi>Joſhua</hi> who purſued them, which was the cauſe of the miracle.</p>
                  <p>I began to be of this opinion long ago, living in a very pleaſant valley amongſt the <hi>Cadur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> Mountaines; whence a little of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven appearing, allow'd us the ſight of the Sun a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſix hours in the Summer, in the foreſaid valley. But the Sun in the mean time who to my thinking was ſet before, through the diſtances and openings betwixt the hills, did beat upon and guild the high ground over againſt it, with which light the whole valley ſhone, till the Sun was under the Horizon. So it came to paſſe, that in the hill over againſt me I ſaw a Sun with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Sun for many hours together, which was to me like a miracle: which ſo often as I ſaw, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought my ſelf of the miracle of <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> that God by a greater miracle could retain the light of the Sun without the Sun, than that by which I
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:62635:128"/>had ſeen the Sun over againſt me upon the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
                  <p>As far as my reaſon could ſerve me, I thought I was arrived to a conjecture; becauſe it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, <hi>Thou Sun upon</hi> Gabaon <hi>move not,</hi> for the Sun at his going down did enlighten the oppoſite Mountain of <hi>Gabaon,</hi> and not every Region of the Horizon, which no doubt it had look'd upon, had it ſtood ſtill in the midſt of heaven; God therefore retain'd in the Mountain of <hi>Gabaon,</hi> and not in all the places of the Horizon, by a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable miracle, that light by which the Sun going down ſhone in that Mountain, and the neighbouring places; Or whether it were better to believe, that the ſimilitude of the Sun going down by the Atmoſphaere, and refractions which are ordinary in it, did appear after the Sun was down; As the <hi>Hollanders</hi> in <hi>Nova Zembla,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a night of 2 moneths and a half long, ſay that they ſaw the Sun a little ſooner than they could expect him, becauſe the Atmoſphaere repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the light of the Sun to them, ſome days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſaw the Sun it ſelf, which <hi>Petrus Gaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſendus</hi> a famous man, and a great Philoſopher known over all the World, hath related and taken ſpecial notice of 1 Book Chap. 19. <hi>Of his Inſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>It is like wiſe written in <hi>Joſua. And the Sun haſtened not to goe down, for the ſpace of a whole day.</hi> Which is expounded in the 46 Chapter of <hi>Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticus. And one day was made as two.</hi> The ſpace of one day, which <hi>Joſua</hi> obſerved, not a whole day, but to be underſtood. For that light of the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:62635:129"/>Sun which gilded the hill of <hi>Gabaon</hi> vaniſhed by little and little, and a light like that of the Moon did ſucceed, till the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had revenged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of their enemies. In which ſenſe thoſe places in <hi>Ioſua</hi> are taken, <hi>Thou Moon move not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Valley of</hi> Ajalon.</p>
                  <p>Alſo in the ſame place of <hi>Ioſua, There was not before, nor ſhall there be hereafter ſo long a day.</hi> And truly, that one day is made as two. It will take but little time up, and it will be worth while to relate a contention betwixt a Minorite Frier, and a Mathematician. The Mathematici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an was ſhewing, that there were days which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the length of many, according to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquitie of the Sphaere, yea a day of ſix moneths, with them who live under the parallel. The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine at this wax'd angry, crying it was impious, and to be puniſhed with a branding Iron, with which Hereticks are marked, to affirm that there could be any longer days, than in the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of <hi>Ioſua,</hi> where one day was made as two: Eſpecially ſince it is directly ſet down. <hi>There has not been, nor ſhall be ſo long a day.</hi> Than which there is nothing more expreſſe, nothing more clear. And we ſhould, ſayes he, makes the holy Scripture a liar (a thing horrid, and not to be thought of) if that were true which the Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician did demonſtrate and therefore that Princes did very well, who did baniſh Mathematicians out of Chriſtendom. My little Prieſt, ſays the Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matician be not ſo fierce, <hi>Your zeal carries you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond your wit.</hi> For both the word of God is true, and that Mathematical demonſtration is likewiſe
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:62635:129"/>true. It is true, that neither before that time, nor ſince, could there be ſo long a day in <hi>Gabaon,</hi> as there was by the command of <hi>Ioſhua.</hi> But ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend not that miracle and that length of day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond <hi>Gabaon</hi> to Neighbouring Nations. For it is true, nor can there be any thing more true, that in thoſe Countries which are near the poles, thoſe days are, and ſhall always be longer than that day, in which, according to the command of <hi>Joſhua</hi> the Sun made not haſt to goe down upon <hi>Gabaon</hi> for the ſpace of one whole day, and one was made as two. For they are really days un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the pole, not of two days, but of a hundred and eighty two days, and more, which the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematician by irrefragable arguments made clear. But the Divine being here baffled, did wrangle to no purpoſe. But that our ſpeech may return whence it begun. The miracle of <hi>Joſhua</hi> muſt in effect not be placed in heaven, but upon the earth, nor upon all the earth neither, but only in the Country of <hi>Gabaon,</hi> In which there never was before, nor ſhall be after ſo long a day, for that could not be made good every wher elſe.</p>
                  <p>There will not be wanting men of ill conceits, who will either render me ſuſpitious, as having an ill opinion, of the faith in miracles, or think me mad, or deſperately bold, that I depart ſo far and wide from the received opinion, who undoubtedly believe that the Sun upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>Joſhua</hi> ſtood ſtill in heaven, as they alſo think, that in the recovery of <hi>Eze.</hi> it went back. They will detract from my conjectures &amp; defame them as riſing from bad Principles, that wil offer to
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:62635:130"/>overcloud the Scripture, where it ſeems to ſpeak ſo clearly, ſaying, that in the miracle of <hi>Ioſhua, It ſtood ſtill in the midſt of heaven,</hi> and upon the prayer of <hi>Iſaiah, it returned ten lines.</hi> Such men as theſe think all things that people wil not believe Religion &amp; Divinity, &amp; miracles with them have the greater repute of ſanctity, the more incredible they are; and which is a ſtrange thing, the more they are paſt belief, the more they believe them: I Ingenuouſly confeſſe, I doe not give in my name amongſt thoſe enormous upholders of mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, who put all reaſon out of ſquare.

I believe thoſe miracles of <hi>Ioſua,</hi> and <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and doe very much magnifie God in them, but think them not greater than they were, nor as is agreeable to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, therefore I have contained them within their own limits. And I beſeech the Reader will not be ſo raſh in his judgement concerning thoſe thoſe things which I have here written.

                  <p>SUch another wonder that is thought indeed, not a miracle, which is read in the 29 Chapter of <hi>Deuteronomie,</hi> where <hi>Moſes</hi> rehearſes this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, and bounty of God to the Jews. <hi>The Lord,</hi> ſays he, <hi>led you forty years through the Deſart, Thy clothes were not worn nor thy ſhoes wax'd not old.</hi> It is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly thought, that the clothes of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> therefore were not worn out, becauſe God had made their clothes incorruptible, as alſo one oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult facultie of growing bigger, that the clothes which the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> put on, ſo ſoon as they grew, they grew likewiſe which they alſo wore. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their ſhooes, that could not be ſpent nor grow old; and ſo ſoon as they put ſhooes upon their childrens feet, as the childrens feet grew, ſo the ſhooes grew likewiſe.</p>
                  <p>This they believe, becauſe they conſider not that the force of this miracle, was nor placed in thoſe idle fancies and childiſh ſtories, but in that wonderfull providence by which God led the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> forty years through the Deſart, deſtitute of all things, notwithſtanding they had ſuch abundance, that they wanted not materials to make clothes &amp; ſhooes of, that their clothes were not worn out, becauſe they had ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral changes, that their ſhooes were not ſpent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:62635:131"/>they found new ones to put on, that they fed a thouſand Flocks in the deſart, of whoſe wool they made cloth and rayment, and of their skins, and leather made ſhoes, and wanted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides no Weavers, Taylors, Curriers, and Shoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers.</p>
                  <p>God ſays moreover in that place, <hi>Bread ye did not eat, Wine or ſtrong drink you did not drink in the Deſart, that you might know that I was the Lord your God.</hi> Manna had reign'd down to them out of Heaven, Water flow'd to them out of the Rock, both by a miracle from God, that they might eat &amp; drink Manna &amp; Water, in lieu of Bread and ſtrong drink. It was likewiſe a miracle from God, that their Flocks ſhould find whereupon to feed, and what to drink in the barren and dry Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                  <p>This was then the force of the miracle meant by <hi>Moſes,</hi> to ſhew that the Jews wanted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for forty years, which by ſeveral ways, but always to the ſame ſence he expreſſed, He opened himſelf more clear in the 2 Chapter of <hi>Deuteronomie, The Lord knows thy journey, how thou paſs'd through this great Deſert dwelling with thee forty years, and thou lacked'ſt nothing.</hi> In which ſenſe underſtand the 8 Chapter of the ſame <hi>Deuteronomie. Thy clothes was not worn out with age, and thy feet were not beaten, behold this is now the fortieth year.</hi> The Garments of the Iſraelites might grow old, but not fail them with antiquity, God not ſuffering them to want new garments to repair the loſſe of the old. Their ſhooes might burſt in their upper leather, but
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:62635:131"/>their feet not to be gall'd, becauſe they had lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enough in the Deſert, ſo that they could not be bruiſ'd either with a worn or cobled ſhooe. So underſtand that place where tis ſaid, <hi>The Jews did not thirſt in the Deſert.</hi> For the Jews might thirſt in the Deſert, but they wanted not wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wherewith to quench their thirſt. Yea whatſoever the words of <hi>Iſay</hi> may ſeem to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porr; The Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> muſt needs be dry in the Deſert, or elſe they had drink in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, for none drinks water but he that is dry. <hi>The fool is dry when water's nigh.</hi> That is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p>
                     <hi>The treaſures of the great depth were opened,</hi> ſayes Geneſis, <hi>and the windows of heaven were opened, and it rained upon the earth forty dayes and forty nights. And there was a deluge upon the earth: and the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were multiplyed: and they lifted up the Ark high from the earth; for they increas'd exceedingly, and fill'd all things upon the face of the earth. And the waters preval'd exceedingly upon the earth. And all the high hils were cover'd under the whole heaven. The water was fifteen cubits above the mountaines which it had cover'd. And all fleſh upon the earth was deſtroyed, birds, living creatures, and beasts, and all creeping things. All men, and all things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is the breath of life, died. And he deſtroyed all things that was upon the earth, from the man to the beaſt, as well creeping things, as fowls of the heaven,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:62635:134"/>and they were cut off from the earth. Only</hi> Noe <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, and thoſe that were with him in the Ark.</hi> All which <hi>Geneſis</hi> prophetically expreſſing and opening, as by inſpiration, ſets forth, to declare, that all the beaſts of the land of <hi>Iudah</hi> periſh'd, when <hi>Paleſtine</hi> was drown'd: which words, if you take only the literal ſence of them, ſeem to intimate, that all the earth, or both Hemiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheres, round about which the Sun takes his courſe, were overflow'd.</p>
                  <p>Nor is it material to me that which is ſaid, <hi>that the treaſures of the great deep were broke up, and the windows of heaven opened;</hi> For, that great Abyſſe was the ſea of <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> from which all the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains ſpring. Which <hi>Geneſis</hi> ſets down to us were to have been broken up, to repreſent to us, that all <hi>Palestine</hi> was diſſolv'd in water, and did ſweat out all the moiſture in its veins. But there are ſome, who to adde force to ſuch things as are hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbolically written, interpret the Cataracts of heaven, The waterie heaven diſgorg'd upon the whole earth; which is a meer ſoppery. For theſe things were written in a high ſtile, to expreſſe the abundance of rain by which the Land of the Jews was overflow'd. <hi>The mountains were covered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the whole heaven,</hi> muſt be underſtood of the high mountains of <hi>Palestine;</hi> as alſo <hi>the whole hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> was that which covered <hi>Paleſtine.</hi> For it is ordinary to aſſign every Country its own heaven. In the ſame ſenſe underſtand the 2 Chapter of <hi>Deutr.</hi> where God caſting a fear upon all the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Holy Land, to which he was to lead his people <hi>Iſrael,</hi> exhorts them in theſe words,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:62635:134"/>
                     <hi>To day I will begin to ſend thy fear and terrour upon the Nations which dwell under the whole heaven.</hi> All the heaven is here underſtood, which was over the whole Land of <hi>Palestine,</hi> For God did not that time ſend the fear of the Jews upon the Nations that dwelt in <hi>China, America,</hi> the South, or <hi>Greenland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if we will take notice of the thing and not of the words, it will appear, that the Deluge came only upon the Land of the Jews, and not upon the whole world. Both from the cauſes of the Deluge, which I now ſpoke of, and which I now told you were the ſins of the Jews.

                  <p>IT is clear, that this Deluge was peculiar to the Jews, not univerſal in all Nations, by that which is written of the Dove, which <hi>Noe</hi> ſent out, and ſhe return'd to him at night. For that branch with green leaves which the Dove pull'd from the tree, was not of thoſe Olives which the Deluge had overwhelm'd; and for a whole year buried them in mudd. Therefore it is more probable to ſay, That that Dove being ſent from the mountains of <hi>Armenia,</hi> flew over all the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Deluge, and in the higher fields of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi> gather'd from an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p>Which that we may more clearly perceive, let us conſider, and recollect that violence, with which the ſhowers of the flood in great bodies of water broke out, and did beat the whole earth, without reſt or interruption day or night. Let us bethink
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:62635:135"/>us how great muddy ſtreams fell from the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains into the valleys, And that deluge made up and ſweld with thoſe torrents, was nothing elſe but Water mix'd with ſlime and clay, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing afterwards macerated for a whole year, in which it was upon the higheſt mountains, and fifteen cubits above them, the dregs of that ſlime falling down to the bottom, ſtuck in the branches of the trees, and every leaf of them. For this we are taught by dayly experience, where troubled and clayie rivers break over their banks; For after the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And thus I conceive, that the fields of upper <hi>Aſia</hi> are higher than the Mountains of <hi>Armenia,</hi> becauſe I think the loweſt earth lies always to the Sea ſide, and thoſe grounds are higher which are the fartheſt from the Sea, and are higher rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, within the uppermoſt and continued Globe of the earth: which we ſee clearly, when we ſee famous and ſwift rivers, through great and long tracts of land; haſten to the ſea, according to that reaſon, by which they flow down from up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ground to a continued deſcent.

<pb n="247" facs="tcp:62635:136"/>that that deluge, which would riſe up to the right and left of that Continent, would only touch the brim of the fountain of <hi>Danow,</hi> and not paſs thoſe lands, and thoſe on the other ſide would remain untouch'd, and dry, as before.</p>
                  <p>Think ſo likewiſe of the deluge of <hi>Noah.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning whoſe waters we might eaſily gather how much of <hi>Aſia</hi> they overflow'd beyond the <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> mountains, if we knew the height of the mountain of <hi>Ararat,</hi> which is one of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and on the top of which the Ark ſtood; and what riſings, and what barrs that Globe of the Continent of <hi>Aſia</hi> rais'd againſt thoſe waters that flow'd down upon them from above; from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, I ſay, thoſe fifteen cubits, by which, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Geneſis,</hi> it was higher than the mountains which it covered.</p>
                  <p>Truly, I really think that the waters of <hi>Noahs</hi> floud roſe a hundred miles, or thereabouts, up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the Continent of <hi>Aſia,</hi> becauſe the continent of that Globe being full of riſings and ſtops, nay, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing it ſelf with very high ridges as far as the hill <hi>Taurus,</hi> broke, as is probable, the for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Grant that all the world was at this time divided by <hi>Phaleg,</hi> could it be poſſible that in five generations: for <hi>Phaleg</hi> is the fifth in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent from <hi>Sem,</hi> that they could inhabite <hi>China, America,</hi> the <hi>Southland,</hi> and <hi>Greenland,</hi> and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever land lies betwixt them? therefore the name of land muſt here he ſtreightned to the cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen land only, which if the buſineſſe be well look'd into, could not be well inhabited and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhed by the offſpring of <hi>Noah</hi> in ten genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <pb n="251" facs="tcp:62635:138"/>
                  <p>But they gueſſe, and raſhly too, that all the places of the earth were divided and inhabited by the Sons of <hi>Noah,</hi> out of an opinion, which, as I ſaid before has prepoſſeſt all perſons, that all the men of the world were drowned in <hi>Noahs</hi> Flood, As alſo from the names of the Sons of <hi>Noah,</hi> which names ſome having ſome affinity, ſome altogether different; they have wreſted to ſome the likelihood of the names of ſome people now remaining or ſome ancient Nation, by meer force, and have brought all thoſe Nations from the Sons of <hi>Noah</hi> by conceited conjectures.</p>
                  <p>See other fancies, they ſay it is written in the tenth Chapter of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> of the Sons of <hi>Japhet. From them the Iſles of the Gentiles were divided, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Countries, every one according to their tongue, and families, in their Nations,</hi> Thoſe Iſles ſome expound, ſuch as are ſcattered all the Sea over, both <hi>Aegean</hi> and <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> and thoſe which the Ocean invirons, <hi>Britain, Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the <hi>Hebrides,</hi> the Weſtern Iſles of <hi>Scotland, Shetland,</hi> and all the reſt of the Iſlands known or unknown. They will have the Sons of <hi>Noah</hi> to have been ſo numerous in the days of the poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Japhet,</hi> that the whole continent of the earth not being able to contain its dwellers, they ſpread themſelves into all the Iſlands far and near; And the Colonies being thronged one upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they divided the land, and dwelt in their own Countries, as it is here written; which whether or no it could come to paſſe in the third generation of the poſterity of <hi>Iaphet,</hi> let any wiſe man be judge. There are thoſe who by all
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:62635:139"/>the earth, underſtand all the earth beyond <hi>Pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine,</hi> and will have <hi>Europe</hi> in that ſenſe, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly call'd one Iſland, according to <hi>Hebrew</hi> authors, if they conjecture that the Sons of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi> did ſail to <hi>Europe,</hi> and divided thoſe vaſt tracts of land, which that the moſt famous quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the earth contains, within the third genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſons of <hi>Iaphet;</hi> which obſerve, for here is the third, only in the lines aſcending to the ſons of <hi>Iaphet.</hi> Yea if they conjecture, that thoſe ſons of the third generation of <hi>Iaphet,</hi> did not only aſſign themſelves <hi>Europe,</hi> becauſe <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> is call'd one Iſland by the Hebrews, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is here written; <hi>That the Iſlands of the Gentiles were divided in their Countries by the ſons of</hi> Japhet, <hi>according to their tongues and families;</hi> how uncertain a faith do they build upon ſuch weak conjectures, eſpecially upon the Hebrew ſpeech, which is ſo much famouus in its ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and ſo ſtrange, that it ſpeaks almoſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Figures?</p>
                  <p>But if there be any faith in conjectures, I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther believe that thoſe Iſlands of the Nations were divided by the ſons of <hi>Iaphet, according to their tongues and families in their Nations,</hi> were the Nations of the holy land, which the Sons of <hi>Iaphet</hi> divided, according to their tongues and families in their Nations. Becauſe the ſame things are there underſtood of the ſons of <hi>Iaphet,</hi> which are ſaid afterwards of the Sons of <hi>Cham,</hi> Theſe are the ſons of <hi>Cham</hi> in their kinreds, tongues, and generations, their lands, and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. For it is to be thought that the ſons of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi>
                     <pb n="253" facs="tcp:62635:139"/>ſetled themſelves in the Countries of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly land, as the ſons of <hi>Cham</hi> did. For if the Sons of <hi>Cham,</hi> being reprobates, had their lot in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly land, which was the land of the Lord, why ſhould not we believe that the Sons of <hi>Iaphet</hi> had likewiſe their portion in the ſame land of the Lord whoſe father the Lord had lov'd and choſen? Truly we have ſhew'd you, that the lots of the ſons of <hi>Shem</hi> and <hi>Cham</hi> fell in that land, why then ſhould only the ſons of <hi>Iaphet</hi> of all the poſterity of <hi>Noah,</hi> be diſ-inherited from the holy land, which was their own? or by what title could they have been call'd by their brethren, being diſ-inherited of that land? Take ſerious notice of theſe words concerning the Sons of <hi>Iaphet. By theſe were the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlands of the Gentiles divided according to their nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi> For I could eaſily believe that <hi>Iſlands</hi> and <hi>Countries</hi> are here the ſame. And the Countries inhabited by every one of theſe Nations are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Iſlands, becauſe hedg'd in by neighbouring Nations, as they call thoſe Iſlands of houſes, which are hedg'd in by lanes round about, why may we not as well ſay Iſlands of the Gentiles, if we ſay Iſlands of houſes? its properly enough uſed.</p>

                     <hi>Euſebius</hi> in his Chronicle is a great motive to perſwade me, that the flood of <hi>Noah</hi> was parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular to the Iews, where about the time of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> birth he ſpeaks thus. <hi>In the three and fortieth year of which</hi> Ninus <hi>reign,</hi> Abraham <hi>was born amongſt the</hi> Hebrews, <hi>It was there the ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teeenth power over the</hi> Egyptians, <hi>which they call a dynaſty, At which time the</hi> Thebeans <hi>rul'd, who go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd the</hi> Egyptians <hi>in the year</hi> 190.

                  <p>It is written, I confeſſe, <hi>That God created the heaven and the earth, in the beginning.</hi> That I dare boldly affirm we know not that beginning. I know there is a ſetled number of the ſtars in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, there is a determinate number of the grains of ſand in the Sea ſhore: But I think to make up a ſum of all thoſe ſtars<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all thoſe grains, all thoſe ages which have bin from the beginning, is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the compaſſe of all Arithmetick and humane account.

                  <p>Moreover I find two ſeveral acceptions of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity in the holy Scripture.

                  </p>
                  <p>There appears here a two-fold beginning, one before time, and before the creation of the earth; one from ages from the beginnings of the earth, or ſince the creation of the world. The firſt is diſtinguiſhed from the ſecond, becauſe in the firſt
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:62635:143"/>God is only ſaid to have poſſeſſed wiſdom: in the ſecond place, to have ordain'd and inſtall'd her to have a rule over all things created. Both beginnings then are eternal, but the firſt antien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt. The firſt beginning was eternal by its ſelf, eternal before eternity. The ſecond begining was eternal, in regard of us, ſince our underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding cannot reach its number.</p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath moſt clearly evidenc'd this to us in the laſt Chapter of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans:</hi> and in the third Chapter of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians:</hi> and in the firſt Chapter of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> when he call'd the Goſpel in theſe places, <hi>An opening of the mysterie, which was hidden and conceal'd from ages, and eternal times.</hi> In his 1 Epiſt. to the <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.

That eternity is called ſecondly, from all time, and from all things. That the eternity which is before eternity, and before eternal times, is the ſame which <hi>Peter</hi> calls, <hi>before the foundation of the world.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the eternity from the foundations of the

                  <p>As if St. <hi>Paul</hi> had meant in thoſe places, which I mentioned before in the former chapters, where he ſaid, that the myſterie of the Goſpel was hid from eternal times and ages, to expreſſe
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:62635:147"/>a thing ſo much ſecret and remote, that the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery had been hidden ſince the world was made with <hi>Adam,</hi> from whom to the Apoſtle was not above four thouſand years.

For eternity here is taken in the ſecond acception, which is from eternity, and ſhall remain to eternity; Which times are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of ages, which ages are accounted by years.</p>
                  <p>Nor think here that age to be the firſt and pure eternity, which admits of no diſtinction of years, of no compoſition or compariſon with this ſecond eternity, which is ſecular &amp; compounded. For although the author of <hi>Eccleſiasticus</hi> ſeems to have taken this out of the 88 <hi>Pſalm,</hi> where it is ſaid, A thouſand years in thy ſight are but as ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterday. It is to be obſerv'd that the Pſalmiſt in that place meant, that there could be no proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or compariſon betwixt 1000 years &amp; Gods e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, which 1000 years he compar'd with a day that is paſt, with that which is not. For there is
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:62635:147"/>no proportion betwixt an entity and a non entity. But in this place the author of <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits a perfect proportion betwixt a thouſand years and the day of eternity, betwixt a drop of water and the whole Sea, betwixt a grain of ſand, and all the ſand in the ſhore.

Theſe are likewiſe compared together, according to the habitude of number and meaſure, which have relation one to another; but there can be no proportion betwixt the eternity of God and a thouſand years; becauſe they are of different kinds: A thouſand years, and that pure eternity are of ſeveral kinds, becauſe that eternity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts not of years, nor is compounded of ages, or times, and they cannot be compared according to their habitudes and meaſures, for they have none common to both.</p>

Of eternity, I ſay, which in that place <hi>Auſonius</hi> ſets down as a <hi>ſecret,</hi> and known to God alone. The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of thoſe eternal ages which were from the beginning, was hid from men, according to that decree, by which he has hindred men to know all things; and through which he thought it fit in his wiſdom that they ſhould be ignorant of the diſpenſations of time: According to that of the Lord when he was aſcending to heaven, <hi>It is not for you to know the times, which the father has put in his own power,</hi> Acts. ch. 1.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Egyptians,</hi> according to <hi>Plato,</hi> aſcrib'd the cauſe of this ignorance to the ſeveral deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men; of which the greateſt were by fire and water, the leſſer by many other ſeveral ways. They ſaid, in ſome long tract of time there were ſome changes and differences of things in motion, both in heaven &amp; earth, &amp; in ſome long

But the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were free from fire and floud: <hi>Nile</hi> ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them from fire: And ſuch was the temper of their climate, that no ſhowr from above had ever water'd them, or ever ſhould. Nor were they water'd at any time with any other water, than which either flow'd over from <hi>Nilus,</hi> or ſprung out of the bowels of the earth. And for that cauſe, being not much ſubject to fire, nor o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verwhelm'd with water, ſome men were always preſerv'd with them, ſometimes more, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times leſſe, but never a general deſolation.

                  <p>This then I muſt prove, and this is only my task, to make it appear that we needed not <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> for our Father, nor traduction of <hi>Adam</hi> to make us partakers of his ſin, as we needed not that Chriſt ſhould be our Father, and his tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction ſhould make us partakers of that grace is by Chriſt, and all the following book ſhall be of this, which ſhall begin with the end of this.</p>

Corrupt and mortal men behov'd to die, to recompence corruption with incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and death with immortality. But ſuch a deſtruction, by which God muſt needs break all men, as it were in a mortar, ſeem'd cruel to God. God had thought it better to heal thoſe whom he would not bruiſe. And by myſtery brought that to paſs, which by harſhneſſe he deem'd incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to himſelf. He reſolv'd that men ſhould die for the death of one man, who ſhould be an expiation forthem. Nor yet by the death of one man, who was ſimply a man, but of man-God.

And who ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come mortal, like to corrupt fleſh, that by this ſimilitude he might make men incorrupt and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal.</p>
                  <p>God decreed that men ſhould die in the death of that man-God, who is Chriſt. But the decree of mens death, which ſhould be to them as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, muſt needs paſſe before the death of man, according to a divine and ſpiritual myſterie to men unknown. And the cauſe of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, which is guilt, by reaſon of ſin, muſt needs paſſe before their condemnation. Men then muſt become guilty by their own ſin, before they were condemned of ſin, and be condemned to die for the puniſhment of ſin. And that guilt is called by the Apoſtle, <hi>the condemnation of ſin in

Men had not ſinn'd againſt God, when that fervour which was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them, the corruption of their imperfect nature, forc'd them headlong from the perfection of their creation to the imperfection of their matter. For no guilt could be imputed by God, no lawfull condemnation pronounced, no death juſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon men, meerly for that backſliding; by which men, who were of their own diſpoſing, turn'd from the uprightneſſe of their creation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the wickedneſſe of their own creation. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording then to that myſterie that God would have all men to die in one God-man; accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that ſame myſterie he reſolv'd, that all ſhould ſin, and by one man be condemn'd; a man I ſay, ſimply ſo, and not a God.

All that my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie, of ſalvation and condemnation of men, in Chriſt and <hi>Adam,</hi> made up the body of the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; that is, the ſpiritual and divine way, above nature, and which is ingendred in all men by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect and myſterie, and not by nature.</p>
                  <p>Whoſoever underſtands the ways of Suppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Law, ſhall eaſily conceive the force of that myſterie, by vertue of which, men ſuffered loſſe of degree, were chang'd or reſtor'd unto their eſtates, and by which things only agreed upon were ratified, and by formality of which they did obtain in antient time, and yet obtain the lordſhip of moſt things. All theſe things might have compaſs'd their effects, and ſhown their natural force, by bare Covenant or conſent, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſuppoſition; But the Lawgivers did i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine ingrafting in theſe things, which were naturally acted, the legalities of their art, to have added a better underſtanding to them: As choice plants grow better, when they are plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in Crab-tree ſtocks, and ſuch as grow wild.</p>
                  <p>God reſolving to reſtore man that had fallen from his creation, would not perfect the work in that direct and natural order as many things are done amongſt men, but by crooked windings of myſtery, by applications, and ſpiritual graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:62635:156"/>he thought beſt to perform the whole work. Such myſteries ſeem to me very well to be titled, Holy draughts, Parables, or Similitudes, as the Apoſtle call'd them in that place of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leventh Chapter to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> where <hi>Iſaac</hi> is preſuppos'd, as a figure of Chriſt, to have laid down his life under the knife, and according to that Parabolical death, reſembling the death of Chriſt, he is preſuppoſed to riſe according to the ſimilitude of the reſurrection of Chriſt: Where <hi>Abraham,</hi> I ſay, is preſuppoſed to have ſacrificed his ſon <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and to have received him again in Parable, or ſimilitude of reſurrection; which the Apoſtle purpoſely, and very ſubtilly obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> hath taught us, that men die in the death of Chriſt, according to parable, and ſimilitude of his death, 6 Chap. to the <hi>Rom.</hi> In which place he directly tels us, that by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm there is ingendred in us not only a ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of his death, but that there is engrafted in them, by that ſame Sacrament, a ſimilitude of his reſurection, <hi>For if we be engrafted in him in his death, ſo ſhall we be alſo in his reſurrection.</hi> And the Apoſtle taught us, that all men ſinn'd, were guiltie, and were condemn'd in <hi>Adam,</hi> who ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned according to the ſimilitude of his tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>According to the ſimilitude of the tranſgreſſion of Adam.</hi> For that is to be underſtood a ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude, and a Parable, no propagation of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as all men died in Chriſt. Which that we may the better underſtand, we muſt more at large handle the ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> which is commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Original ſin.</hi>

                  <head type="sub">Of Original ſin. It is inherent. It is imputed. What it is to impute. That is imputed, which is joyn'd in a kind of communion with that to which it is impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Of communions and conjunctions of things, Phyſical, Political, and Mystical. Chriſt the end of all myſteries. <hi>Adam</hi> ought to be referr'd to Christ, not Chriſt to <hi>Adam. Adam</hi> ought to be imputed to men, as Chriſt is imputed to them ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually and myſtically,</head>
                  <p>WHat I ſhall ſpeak firſt concerning Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſin, is aſſerted by all Orthodox Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines. That ſin is conſider'd two manner of ways, either as ſin, or as a guilt; as a ſin, ſo it is inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; as it is a guilt, it is adventitious, and paſs'd from <hi>Adam</hi> upon them all. The one is proper to all men; the other a ſtranger, and call'd the ſin of <hi>Adam.</hi> The firſt is the formality; the ſecond is the materiality of the ſin. The materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſin is proper, and inherent, <hi>an hereditary di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe,</hi> or blemiſh, in which all men are conceiv'd and born, according to that of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>In ſin hath my Mother conceiv'd me.</hi> A formal ſin, which is anothers, and is become a guilt; which was <hi>the diſobedience of Adam imputed to all men:</hi> according to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>By the diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of one, many became ſinners.</hi> The materiality of ſin, which is the proper fault and infection in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in all, by propagation of the matter and nature of men ſubject to corruption. The forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:62635:157"/>of ſin, which is a ſtranger, and tranſient, had its beginning from imputation, by the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of the Law which <hi>Adam</hi> did vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late.</p>
                  <p>To impute to any one the ſin of another, is to eſteem him in the ſame condition, as if he had committed the fault himſelf: Otherwiſe it is not anothers fault, but his own, which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to him. Beſide, the fault of one uſes to be imputed to another, which has ſome communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or conjunction with him, as having ſome man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of corporal ſocietie and ſimilitude with him; For, as ſmoke coming near the fire takes fire, by reaſon of the ſimilitude and aptitude is has to flame: ſo things that have a communion and conjunction betwixt them, are apt, or ſuſceptive one of anothers imputations.</p>
                  <p>Communions and conjunctions of things fit for imputation by reaſon of their ſimilitude, are three-fold, <hi>Phyſical, Political,</hi> and <hi>Myſtical.</hi> The fault of their Fathers is imputed to the Children, by reaſon of that common and natural ſimilitude, by which ſons begotten of their fathers are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally joyn'd to them. The ſons are ſaid to have ſinn'd in the loyns of their Fathers, as <hi>Levi</hi> is ſaid to be taken for tithe in the loyns of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Abraham, Heb.</hi> 7. As alſo the <hi>Hebrews</hi> are ſaid all to be taken by God in the hand of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> their Father, <hi>Iſay</hi> 41. There are both divine and humane Lawes for imputations ordain'd, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to natural communion and ſimilitude. The divine, by which God is ſaid <hi>to viſit the ſins of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:62635:157"/>generation:</hi> And according to that here, the fathers are ſaid <hi>to eat the ſowr grapes, and the childrens teeth to be ſet an edge.</hi> The humane law, by which there is puniſhment decreed againſt the Children of the Traytors by the guilt of their Parents. There are examples both divine and humane, of impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Fathers fault to the Children: That amongſt divine examples is eminent of the ſeven ſons of <hi>Saul,</hi> whom, according to the command of God, <hi>David</hi> gave the <hi>Gabaonites</hi> as an expiation, becauſe their Father before had broke his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe with the <hi>Gabaonites,</hi> and cruelly ſlain many of them. Its read of <hi>Alexander,</hi> that after he had taken <hi>Tyre,</hi> as if he had been the defender of the publique tranquility, he crucified all the <hi>Tyrians</hi> who outlived the ſiedge, who were born of thoſe ſlaves their Anceſtors, who long before had deſtroyed the free people of <hi>Tyre,</hi> together with their Maſters, cruelly, by a conſpiracy made againſt them.</p>
                  <p>God imputed to the Jews the numbring of the people, which <hi>David</hi> had cauſ'd, and conſumed ſeventy thouſand of them with the plague, for their Kings offence. For that communion and conjunction politique, whereby the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is thought one and one entire body, like a living creature, whoſe head is their King: And as a murther performed by the hand is not only imputed to the hand, but the whole man: So in a body politique, that which the head doth, as being head, is imputed to the whole body. It is the work of <hi>Iove,</hi> ſays <hi>Heſiod,</hi> to puniſh Cities promiſcuouſly for the tranſgreſſion of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate.
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:62635:158"/>So becauſe the Prieſt of <hi>Apollo</hi> was vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> the whole Army of the Greeks was almoſt deſtroyed by Peſtilence. And whatſoever the Prince did amiſſe, the Greeks ſmarted for't. Nor only the act of the head of a City, but alſo of another member, makes the whole body liable to guilty. So as it is read of <hi>Achan. Who having taken of the accurſed thing, brought all</hi> Iſrael <hi>under a curſe,</hi> Joſue 7. And which is alſo read of the Levites Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine, 19 <hi>Judges,</hi> whom the Inhabitants of <hi>Gabea</hi> of the tribe of <hi>Benjamin</hi> ſwiv'd to death. And whoſe wickedneſſe was ſo rigidly imputed to all the Tribe, that all the Tribe for that wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, was almoſt deſtroyed and routed out. Nor were the Heathens ignorant of ſuch imputations. As <hi>Heſiod</hi> ſays, <hi>Many times,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the whole Country is destroyed.</hi> And <hi>Horace.</hi>

                  </q>
                  <p>Thoſe imputations which by politique Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion are contracted from the offences of others, others of them are of the law of Nations, others according to Civil law. According to the Law of Nations, the fault of <hi>Sedecias</hi> by perjury was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to the whole Nation; for which cauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing overcome, and falling into the Enemies hands, they were all carryed Captives to <hi>Babilon</hi> By the ſame Law of Nations, whatſoever the Ambaſſadour tranſacts, is imputed to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, or the Nation, as alſo 'tis imputed
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:62635:158"/>to the pledges, whatſoever is done by them who give the pledges. By Civil law it is imputed to the whole people, whatſoever the chief procurer does for the people, and to the chief in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whatſoever they doe in behalf of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; To the Colonie or Colledge, whatſoever their Truſtees ſhall do in their behalf; To Pupils and Minors is imputed, whatſoever ſhall be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt them, according to the conſent of the Tutors or Overſeers.</p>
                  <p>There are likewiſe myſtical bodies, which by their myſtical Communion and ſimilitude do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage imputations. Such is that myſtical body by which all men, as it were by a myſtical conglu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tination are joyned with him, by reaſon of that ſimilitude they have with Chriſt; For God did not put on the ſhape of an Angel, but the ſhape of a Man, that he might become in all things like to men, except Sin, that he might be a fellow ſufferer with men, and be an expiation for them. By that myſtical Communion and ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by which his death is imputed to all men. Such is that myſtical Communion and ſociety by which the faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> is imputed to all the faithful, And all the faithfull are call'd the Sons of <hi>Abraham,</hi> not the Sons of Nature; but the ſons of Adoption, and myſtical ſimilitude, which did unite all things: According to that ſame Communion and myſtical ſociety, the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> was imputed to other men. For although <hi>Adam</hi> was made by Gods hands, by a peculiar and choice way of framing, beyond other men: yet God had fram'd him, as in other places. I
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:62635:159"/>took notice of the ſame clay, of the ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon earth, and of the ſame matter, ſubject to corruption, in which all other men were created. And in all things was <hi>Adam</hi> made like other men, with ſin alſo. Yea even as fin was a natural imperfection, to all inherent, and proper to <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf, and ſo to all men; And likewiſe as all men by reaſon of that ſociety of ſinning, were apt or ſuceptive of that guilt which came by the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is commonly believ'd that the death of Chriſt was imputed to men, becauſe the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> was imputed to them. They are decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that think ſo; Yea upon the contrary, the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> was purpoſely imputed to men, that the death of Chriſt might be imputed to them likewiſe; For Chriſt ought not to be referr'd to <hi>Adam,</hi> but <hi>Adam</hi> ought to be referr'd to Chriſt: For all things tend towards their end for which they are made: Chriſt was the end of all myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; therefore were all myſteries meerly for Chriſt, and not Chriſt for the myſteries. <hi>Adam</hi> was a type of Chriſt, But Chriſt was a prototype of <hi>Adam.</hi> A type is referr'd to a prototype, and not a prototype to its type.</p>
                  <p>Nor for any other cauſe was the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> imputed to men, than that the death of Chriſt, which appeals for all mens ſins, and regenerates them, might be alſo imputed to them. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in Gods decree the imputation was firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd in the death of Chriſt. Secondly in the ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> as you ſhall read it in the <hi>Revelations, That Chriſt was a Lamb ſlain from the ordaining of
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:62635:159"/>the world.</hi> Yea, and that the myſtery of ſhedding his blood was known and decreed before the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining of the world. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> chap. 1. Which you ſhall never find of <hi>Adam,</hi> becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> ought to be referr'd to Chriſt, as the principle decree of God, and his own firſt type.</p>
                  <p>But theſe things which were firſt in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree and council of God, were not alſo in order of the performance made firſt. Hence alſo it happens, that the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> went before the death of Chriſt; And hence it comes to paſſe that the imputation of the ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> is thought the cauſe of the imputation of the death of Chriſt, though indeed by reaſon of the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the death of Chriſt, the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> was imputed; Yea, becauſe really and properly God, by the ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> made way to the Covenant of grace, which is by Jeſus Chriſt: Therefore the firſt born reaſon of thoſe imputations was in the death of Chriſt; the condition of which, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary imputation of <hi>Adam,</hi> ſin muſt needs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, and as Chriſt was not imputed by Nature, but by the meer myſtery of God, ſo was <hi>Adam</hi> imputed to men, not by nature but by the meer diſpenſation of the divine myſtery.</p>

                  <p>CHriſt and <hi>Adam</hi> were types one of another, or rather antitypes, and by diſſimilitude like one another, like becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> &amp; Chriſt are both imputed after the ſame manner by diſſimilitude, becauſe Chriſt was imputed for juſtice, <hi>Adam</hi> was imputed for ſin; but juſtice and ſin are quite different.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Adam</hi> and Chriſt were in theſe myſtical impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations chief, the middle betwixt them was <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham:</hi> The guilt of <hi>Adam</hi> was imputed to all men, that the expiation of that guilt might like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be imputed to them; I ſay, that it might be imputed to them by faith in God, which is in Chriſt; ſuch as <hi>Abraham</hi> firſt had, and it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to him for Juſtice; But it is not writ for <hi>Abrahams</hi> own ſake, that his faith was imputed to him for juſtice, but likewiſe for us, ſaith the Apoſtle, that is for all men, to whom it ſhall be imputed, <hi>believing in him that raiſ'd Jeſus Chriſt from the dead, who was betrayed for the ſins of men,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:62635:160"/>and roſe again for the juſtification of them.</hi> In the <hi>Rom.</hi> chap. 4. <hi>Abraham</hi> was the original and fountain of that juſtification in that ſenſe, as he is call'd the Father of all believers in the ſame place of the <hi>Romans.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All that myſtery then of regeneration of men, which is mens redemption, ſanctification, and ſalvation, conſiſts in theſe thtee myſtical impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. The imputation of the ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> The imputation of the expiation of it by the death of Chriſt, And the imputation of the faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> which was the mean or mid path by which we ſhould paſſe from the ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> to that juſtification and ſanctification which by the death of Chriſt, and his reſurrection, is engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in men. There was then a continued impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation from the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> to the death of Chriſt, by the faith of <hi>Abraham.</hi> And the whole myſtery of mans redemption was accompliſhed in the perſons of three Jews, <hi>Adam, Abraham,</hi> and Chriſt, accordnig as ſalvation comes to all the Nations by the Jews, according to the promiſe confirm'd to <hi>Abraham, That in him all nations ſhould be bleſſed, and in his ſeed.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Adam</hi> was the Father of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the fleſh, and according to the imputation of ſin: he was likewiſe the Father of Chriſt, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the fleſh, without the defiling of the fleſh. <hi>Abraham</hi> was the Father of Chriſt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the blood, without the blemiſh of the blood, he was likewiſe the Father of <hi>Adam,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the imputation of faith. Chriſt was the Father of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> according to
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:62635:161"/>the redemption and expiation of that ſin which flow'd from <hi>Adam,</hi> and was imputed to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi> In that theſe three heads of thoſe myſtical imputations agree. That thoſe three Jews were the Fathers of all Nations, not according to the fleſh, but each of them according to his own my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical imputation. But the Gentiles are indeed the Sons both of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally, but according to their engrafting and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical adoption, according to which, <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> being Jews were imputed to the Gentiles; that Chriſt being a Jew might be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to them alſo.</p>
                  <p>Myſtical imputations ſhare in all kind of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and politique imputation. A natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of bodies is common both to the myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and Phyſical imputation, which by traducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in propagation is ingendred in myſtical impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and a myſtical imputation is imagin'd in the ſimilitude of creation, and formation. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that myſtical communion and conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> are call'd our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and we are ſaid to be begotten in Chriſt; For theſe three men were common Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of all men, ſuppoſing the whole <hi>ſpecies.</hi> But as <hi>Adam, Abraham,</hi> and Chriſt were all men: even ſo were all men one in <hi>Adam, Abraham,</hi> and Chriſt, by unity of ſimilitude, and participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the nature; as amongſt Philoſophers, all men participating of the ſame <hi>ſpecies</hi> are reputed one man: alſo, amongſt Divines the whole <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> of men is believed to be depoſited in thoſe three, <hi>Adam, Abraham,</hi> and Chriſt. In <hi>Adam,</hi>
                     <pb n="297" facs="tcp:62635:161"/>according to ſin; in <hi>Abraham,</hi> according to faith; in Chriſt, according to redemption.</p>
                  <p>Myſtical imputations agree with imputations politique, in that <hi>Adam, Abraham,</hi> and Chriſt, were the chief preſidents, cautioners, and ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for all mankind. That whatſoever <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould do as to the Law; Chriſt, in the buſineſs of Redemption; <hi>Abraham</hi> in matter of Faith, ſhould ſtand firm. Certainly <hi>Adam,</hi> of whom we chiefly here ſpeak, was according to divine Law in an univerſal eſteem, as a Prince in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of his people, Embaſſadors for a Kingdom or Commonwealth, or a Preſident for the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities. And <hi>Adam</hi> was ſo ordain'd, being the Prince of all mankind; that ſo ſoon as he ſhould tranſgreſſe the Law of God, he ſhould not onely be guilty himſelf, but make all men guilty like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: for, as the Divines ſay, the act of <hi>Adam</hi> was not perſonal, but repreſentative; that is, it was not the act of one perſon, but of a perſon repreſented others, as ſuſtaining the perſon of all mankind.</p>
                  <p>God had oblig'd all men in that Covenant which he made with <hi>Adam,</hi> as with a ſecurity, a Procurer or Protector of them, that what he ſhould ſin in, they ſhould alſo all be guilty. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> had a charge from God, not from men; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which he might trannſact mens buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe without their knowledge. <hi>Adam</hi> broke the Covenant of God, and according to that puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of imputation, which God upon that breach deſtin'd for all men, all men are likewiſe thought to have broke it. <hi>Adam</hi> was a common Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:62635:162"/>of all men. Men ſinn'd in general by a unition to that repreſentative, as the School-men ſay: and as Chriſt, our Juſtice, was the form of the myſtical imputation, according to the ſame manner of imputation was <hi>Adam</hi> our ſin.</p>
                  <p>It is known, that puniſhments by Natural and Political imputations, have not only ſeized up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mens perſons, but have by the ſins of men had likewiſe an influence both upon things living and dead. Not that the ſins of men were impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to men; but that by the damage of ſuch things which were profitable to men, thoſe errours which they had committed might be more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to them: ſo we read, that for the ſin of men all things that were upon the face of the earth were deſtroyed, from men to beaſts, as well creeping things, as the fowls of heaven. Moreover, for the wickedneſſe of the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> both their Towns and themſelves were deſtroy'd. What ſhall I mention, that for the wickedneſs of the Jews their earth was made iron, that the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven became braſſe, and fires were kindled to burn every tree, both dry and green, That became common by the myſtical imputation of the ſin of <hi>Ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>m;</hi> For the earth was curs'd for the rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Adam.</hi> The Serpent was accurs'd among all creatures and beaſts of the field. He was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to goe upon his belly, and commanded to ear duſt all the days of his life: and thoſe things which were joyn'd in no ſocietie with <hi>Adam,</hi> endur'd the condemnation of that fault.</p>
                  <p>This was the difference betwixt inflicting of
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:62635:162"/>puniſhments in Phyſical, and puniſhments or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd upon the Myſtical imputation of the ſin of <hi>Adam.</hi> That thoſe puniſhments were Phyſical and real, according to their Phyſical and real im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations: the other Myſtical, and ſpiritually underſtood, according to the ſpiritual and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical imputation of the ſin of <hi>Adam.</hi> Certainly, the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> added nothing to the ſinfull na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man, but a meer guilt, which ought myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally to be underſtood. Nor did the puniſhment ordain'd againſt him from the imputation of ſin, add any thing to the corruption and natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of men, but a myſticall condemnation, which could only be imagin'd in the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. The puniſhment decreed againſt the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, added nothing to the reptile nature of the Serpent, beſides a condemnation meerly ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and myſtical; For according to the reptile con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of his nature and his creation, the Serpent was to creep upon his belly, and to eat duſt all the dayes of his life; which I ſhew'd before, and thought fit here to rehearſe. The puniſhment decreed againſt the earth, to bring forth Thorns and Thiſtles, added nothing to the condition of the earth, but the meer imagination of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; For the earth is properly called, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of thorns and thiſtles. The puniſhment pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt men, that in the ſweat of their brows they ſhould eat their bread, added no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the natural deſtinie of men, but a bare myſterie of condemnation: For a man is born to labour, and a fowl to fly. And it is as natural for a man to labour, as to a fowl to flie. And the
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:62635:163" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſame is to be thought of the pains of women in child-birth. Nor did the condemnation of death pronounced againſt <hi>Adam,</hi> adde any thing to the natural death, by which <hi>Adam,</hi> and all men, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Law of their creation ought to die, beſides the myſtical condemnation, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in myſterie and ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Adam</hi> is underſtood to be dead according to that condemnation, and all men are underſtood to be dead in <hi>Adam,</hi> by that myſterie, and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical way of imputation, by which the death of Chriſt ought to be apply'd to <hi>Adam,</hi> and to all men. Nor did <hi>Adam</hi> really die, nor man ever dy'd really by the decree of that condemnation: one Chriſt alone, who was the expiation for all ſin, both ought to doe, and did that, and dy'd for <hi>Adam</hi> and all men, and repeal by his death that condemnation which was gone out againſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and all mankind. Yea, Chriſt himſelf, who was ſlain, before the world was ordaind, and to whom was allotted the task of expiating <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi> ſin, ſucceeded in <hi>Adams</hi> place at the very minute when <hi>Adam</hi> ſinn'd, and in the place of all men, who were eſteem'd to ſin in <hi>Adam.</hi> And God ſuſtain'd the puniſhment for <hi>Adam,</hi> and for all men, who ought to have dyed for <hi>Adam,</hi> and who from that very minute wherein <hi>Adam</hi> dy'd, were underſtood dead, not really and actually, for they could not, becauſe they had no being as yet, but by the force of myſterie, and that myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal imputation which was in force after the death of Chriſt, and before the death of Chriſt, upon men not as yet born.</p>

                  <head type="sub">The imputation of another mans ſin is not conceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but by ſome ſuppoſition in Law. <hi>Adams</hi> ſin was imputed to all men in a ſpiritual manner, not by natural propagation. Divines confuſe nature and guilt, which ought to be underſtood apart in original ſin. Nature is before guilt. Guilt did not corrupt nature; yea on the contrary corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture caus'd guilt. Which is prov'd by the example of <hi>Adam</hi> when he ſinn'd.</head>
                  <p>IT is a moſt certain truth, of which no Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Divine makes any queſtion, That God in a ſecret way, and by a marvellous myſterie, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to all men, the ſin of one man. And that all mankind had a being in one man, not truly and properly, but myſtically, which is ſo to be underſtood, by a certain preſuppoſition in the Law of God, according to the words of no ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Divine, <hi>The whole nature of man,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>was in one man</hi> Adam, <hi>as in the head.</hi> And all we, not truly and properly, for that time truly and properly we were not in being, but potentially and virtually, or by a certain ſuppoſition in Gods Law, in the act of <hi>Adam</hi> broke the Law of God, and tranſgreſſed his Covenant, as ſayes the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>And truly, if we take diligent heed, there is no imputation from anothers fault, whether Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, Political, or Myſtical, or any other kinde, which is any other than imaginary, or can any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:62635:164"/>way be conceived than by imagination, which is chiefly to be thought of myſtical impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, which are leſſe corporeal, and more ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, and therefore more apt for fiction.</p>
                  <p>That is, according to imputation, myſtical, which the Apoſtle ſays <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. That uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion is reputed to them that keep the Law for circumciſion: But how could the uncircumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be thought circumciſed, but by that ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which being corporeal is conceived in ſpirit and thought? The ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> was made the ſin of all men by imputation, and that ſame ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of myſtery, by which all men that are, that were, that ſhall be, are imagined to have pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that forbidden fruit with their own hands, at the ſame time when <hi>Adam</hi> did ſnatch it, and to have eaten it at the ſame time when <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> ſwallowed it, and by which ſuppoſition the numerical ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> is thought to be nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically the ſin of all men, he, in whom all men are thought to have been in him; all men are ſaid to have ſinn'd, and ſo have deſerved death: Nor were all men really and actually in <hi>Adam,</hi> nor are they to be thought to have ſinn'd really and actually, nor did they really and naturally deſerve death by that ſin, but by force of myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which I have often repeated interpretatively, and imputatively, as the Divine ſays, which was meerly by ſuppoſition.</p>
                  <p>And ſince theſe things are undoubted and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved firmly: I ſee nothing that may be any ways prejudicial to Chriſtian Doctrine, if I ſay, that we did not need <hi>Adam</hi> for our naturall Father
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:62635:164"/>and begetter of all Mankind, to have his ſin im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to all men. For to what purpoſe ſhould there here be a confuſion of myſtical and natural, &amp; of imputation meerly ſpiritual, with propagati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on meerly natural; For the guilt of imputation which is by <hi>Adam,</hi> and natural wickedneſſe, which is by traduction, and propagated by gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, are different.</p>
                  <p>The Divines doe confeſſe thoſe two together, who ſay, that original both as it is imputed, and as it is naturally deriv'd, came from one foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, <hi>Adam:</hi> They acknowledge a diſtinct and real difference betwixt myſtical and phyſical, that which is imputed, &amp; that which is naturally inherent. They ſay likewiſe that it is not by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that all men are condemn'd for one mans fault. They acknowledge ſomething elſe, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther communication; which is by imputation, my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, and by the councell of God; beſides the natural way of Propagation, by which ſin is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in men. They know alſo that none will aſcribe that to the unſerchable judgments of God, that a ſickly man begets a ſickly man, that a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed perſon begets a diſeaſed perſon: But that comes not by miracle, but by nature, and an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary way: They alſo call that ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> which was firſt imputed to all men, that defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, tranſgreſſion, a thing tranſient and actual. They call that ſin, which is naturally inherent in all perſons, a corruption, an infection, deprava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a ſin ſprung up, permanent, internal, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, habitual. And although theſe two ſins are ſo much different one from the other, as myſtery
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:62635:165" rendition="simple:additions"/>is different from nature, imputation from natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral inherence, external and adventitious from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal and proper, material and corporeal from formal and ſpiritual, which is utterly another thing. Notwithſtanding the Divines make up one original ſin of theſe two ſins, which, they ſay, conſiſts of two parts, imputation, and real communication of corruption; out of two wholes they make up the two parts of one. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, they ſay, that the imputation of the firſt ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> and his inbred corruption, are ſo indiviſibly link'd, that they make not up more guilts, but one entire guilt, which by traducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of propagation, as they ſay, paſſ'd upon all men: But we ſhall readily prove out of the Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. That ſin naturally inherent, is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginally different from that which is imputed, &amp; and that theſe two ſins were not always inviſibly joyn'd, nor were not always the ſame original ſin, ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>Until the Law ſin was in the world.</hi> If ſin was in the world until the Law, it was before the Law alſo, and had its ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal before the Law. Certainly that ſin which was before the Law, was not ſin imputed, becauſe ſin imputed was not before the Law, but by the Law after the Law; for the imputation of ſin could only come by the Law. And theſe two ſins come only under conſideration, Imputative, and Naturally inherent. Therefore if ſin impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted was not before the Law, certainly that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral inherent ſin muſt be before the Law, which was not imputed when there was no Law. And again, if ſin which was imputed, had its original
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:62635:165"/>from the Law, that which was naturally inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, no doubt, was the Anceſtors, being before the Law. The Law was by <hi>Adam,</hi> and was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven when <hi>Adam</hi> was made: Therefore ſin na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally inherent was ancienter than <hi>Adam,</hi> and ancienter than ſin imputed, which had its origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal from <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And that I may make it appear by plain truth, and demonſtrate it by an irrefragable argument, that ſin naturally inherent was by inbred corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the viciouſneſſe of mans nature; that it was ancienter than the ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> which in <hi>Adam</hi> was imputed to all men, we muſt more narrowly pry into the Hiſtory of <hi>Gen.</hi> and the ſin of <hi>Adam. The Woman ſaw,</hi> ſaith <hi>Gen. That the tree was good to eat, fair to the eye, and delightfull to behold; and ſhe took the fruit, and did eat, and ſhe gave it to her Husband, and he did eat.</hi> Where you ſee clearly, that the ſen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>es of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were corrupted before both did eat and ſin.

The corrupt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of <hi>Adam,</hi> corrupted him, by that ſmall fault of this corruption which was inherent to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam.</hi> So ſoon as he ſaw it, he was undone. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> ſinn'd by his ſight, before he ſinn'd by his taſt: He ſaw the fruit, and as his liver was apt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence, he covered it.

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n which was impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him from the tranſgreſſion of the Law, not from the corruption of nature.</p>
                  <p>They that interpret the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> Allegori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, ſay, that the Serpent washisſenſe, the Woman the reaſon, the Man the intellect; the fervent perſwaſion of his ſenſe blinded his reaſon, and reaſon deprated blinded his intellect. The cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt ſenſe of <hi>Adam</hi> ſinn'd, his crooked reaſon was faulty, before that his vitiated intellect had ſinn'd. Hence you may ſee how prepoſterouſly they overturn the order of things, that ſay <hi>Adams</hi> reaſon was therefore deprated, his ſenſes cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, becauſe he had eaten the forbidden fruit; Nay rather, upon the contrary, <hi>Adam</hi> ſinn'd ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the forbidden fruit, becauſe his ſenſes were firſt corrupted, his reaſon firſt depraved. And <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> ſinn'd twice, firſt in his ſences and reaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſinn'd in his intellect and will, in that ſin which was imputed to him, and in him to all men. Here obſerve the force of that innate and inherent corruption, before the fruit touch'd
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:62635:166"/>his lips. His concupiſcence was neither afraid of the edict of God, nor dreaded death, which was threatned to him; yea ſuch was the fury of his Nature, that he would have endured death in the bittereſt manner, rather than he would not ſatisfie his appetite.</p>
                  <p>I acknowledge that the imputation of his ſin and inbred corruption were joyn'd in him after he had ſinn'd. But theſe were not always joyn'd in <hi>Adam:</hi> That league was not entred before the Law of God, and before the expiation of it: The inbred and innate corruption of <hi>Adam,</hi> was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inherent to him before his fall. That natural corruption was the ſin, of which the Apoſtle, <hi>Which was before the Law, which was not imputed, becauſe ſin is not imputed where there is no Law.</hi> And there was firſt an inbred corruption in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> before that imputation, which was cauſ'd by the tranſgreſſion of that Law. Therefore the imputation of ſin was the Mother of his inbred corruption, which begat the imputation of ſin. Sin naturally inherent ought to be firſt before ſin which was imputed, as nature was before imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or myſtery.</p>
                  <p>As alſo ſin naturally inherent was not impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted according to Law, there being no Law; nor was there any legal guilt by that ſin; for guilt and imputation are the ſame things: Nor could it be ſaid, that under the Law legal impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and imbred corruption were indiviſibly joyn'd, and made up but one guilt of two. Under the Law legal imputation of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred corruption joyn'd: But therefore were not
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:62635:167"/>ſo indiviſibly &amp; cloſely joyn'd, that they made the leaſt confuſion of guilts; for there was never any guilt of anothers ſin by imbred corruption. The legal imputation of <hi>Adams</hi> guilt, flow'd from the tranſgreſſion of the Law by <hi>Adam,</hi> which paſſed upon all men; from imbred corruption flow'd ſin naturally inherent, not anothers ſin, but every mans own ſin, proper and particular to himſelf; which is not imputed by the Law, and by the adventitious ſin of <hi>Adam;</hi> but the very nature of the ſin inherent from ones imbred cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption is naturally aſcribed to all men, that they may undergo death, which is according to nature, nor attain to immortality, which is above nature.</p>

                  <p>ONe opinion, as it is uſual, is begotten by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. They who think that men took their

Furthermore, this opinion, as I ſaid, thence took its beginning, becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> is thought the Original of all men. And that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion again hence is imagin'd, becauſe they think that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpoke of <hi>Adam,</hi> as the firſt Father of all men, becauſe there is no other man named in <hi>Moſes</hi> Books before <hi>Adam:</hi> as if there never had been nothing in nature, nor in the world, which <hi>Moſes</hi> had not mention'd. But <hi>Moſes</hi> tels us no where that which St. <hi>Paul</hi> firſt declar'd, <hi>That ſin enter'd into the world by the ſin of</hi> Adam, <hi>and that death by that ſin paſſ'd upon all men:</hi> although <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> ſaid no ſuch thing, yet he no where denyed it. And no where hath he ſaid that which St. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſly declares, <hi>That ſin was in the world until the Law,</hi> or before the Law, which is the ſame thing; I ſay, that firſt, and firſt-born Law, as the beſt Divines call it, and which is here to be underſtood, as being the firſt of all Laws which God gave to <hi>Adam,</hi> and from which proceeded the imputation of ſin: Nor did <hi>Moſes</hi> deny that
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:62635:168"/>which <hi>Paul</hi> affirmed, Therefore it is better to aſſert it, ſince the Apoſtle affirms, <hi>Moſes</hi> does not deny it, that there were men before <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam.</hi>

                  <p>As it was never the intention of the Apoſtle to derive the original of all men from <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo alſo the Apoſtle never intended ſo to joyn ſin naturally inherent, with ſin imputed: and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it is as clear as Noon-day, That the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle never made any mixtures of theſe ſins, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5 where he manifeſtly writes concerning the ſin which in <hi>Adam</hi> was imputed, <hi>By one man,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>ſin entred into the world.</hi> That by one man St. <hi>Paul</hi> afterwards explains, not by traduction from one man, and natural propagation, but by his diſobedience, which is moral and ſpiritual; <hi>By the diſobedience,</hi> ſays he, <hi>of one man, many became ſinners.</hi> He did not then joyn that which is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and ſpiritual, with that which is material, and naturally propagated.</p>

                  <p>Which that you may the more clearly know, remember what I ſaid before; That no man ever dyed for the ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> but one Chriſt alone, in whom, according to myſtical imputation, all men are thought dead, as all men are thought to have ſinn'd in <hi>Adam.</hi> They are, I ſay, thought dead in Chriſt, by ſimilitude, parable, and fiction, myſtically, as <hi>Iſaac</hi> was ſuppoſed kill'd by his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as before out of the eleventh Chapter to the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> That death then, of which here the Apoſtle ſpeaks, was myſtical; fictitious, and Parabolical, which enſued upon <hi>Adams</hi> myſtical, fictitious, &amp; Parabolical ſin. Which death no man ever actually ſuffer'd in Chriſt, as no man actually or really ever ſinn'd in <hi>Adam.</hi> The Apoſtle ſpoke in this place, not of that ſin which was naturally inherent to all men, but only of that which by myſtical imputation paſſ'd upon all men from the ſin of <hi>Adam.</hi> The Apoſtle ſpoke likewiſe here
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:62635:169"/>not of that death which is naturally riveted to mans corruption, but of that only which follow'd the nature of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, and which by myſtical imputation, paſſed from the death of Chriſt upon all men. And Chriſts death was call'd a tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent death, as the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> was call'd a tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſin. <hi>Death,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>paſſed upon all men;</hi> that he might intimate that he had nothing here to do with that death, which by their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural corruption is naturally inherent to them, and happens to them naturally; but onely of that which in the expiation of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin by the death of Chriſt paſſes upon all men.</p>

For that condemnation hung over all mens heads, and reign'd over them from <hi>Adam</hi> til <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> and that time layd a tie of Law upon all men. Nor did death properly, as I ſaid before, reign upon all men, becauſe no man properly dyed for
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:62635:169"/>the ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> but properly the condemnation of death which reigned over them, was that, which by the death of Chriſt was blotted out, taken away, and nailed to the Croſſe.</p>
                  <p>God appointed then <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> the known limits and times for <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, or to that death or condemnation of death, which was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed by that ſin; But the ſame God appointed no limits, no times, either to ſin naturally inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, or to death, which by natural default is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent to all perſons.

The laſt enemy which ſhall be deſtroyed, is death; For natural and inherent death is not yet deſtroyed, which follows the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of its natural and inherent ſin.

                  <p>Therefore the Apoſtle did not joyn theſe two, which he handled apart, and which the order of things ſet at a diſtance; that is, ſin Imputed, and ſin Naturally inherent, death reigning by the imputation of ſin; and death naturally following ſin naturally inherent.

                     </gap>ivides that ſpiritual and myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſubject from the material and natural, to ſhew that there was no need of the traduction of <hi>Adam,</hi> material and natural, towards the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, which was myſtical and ſpiritual; which he more openly declares, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. where he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares the obedience of Chriſt with the diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of <hi>Adam,</hi> and the imputation which did abound, from the ſin of one <hi>Adam,</hi> to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of death, with the imputation of grace, which is given from above, of which is given to the ſatisfaction of life, in the offering up of one Jeſus Chriſt, which are nothing material or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, but relliſh altogether of ſpirit and myſtery. And that the compafiſon of <hi>Adam</hi> and Chriſt may be abſolute, <hi>Adam</hi> ought to be imputed to men after the ſame manner, ſpiritually and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtically, as Chriſt is imputed.</p>
                  <p>The beſt Divines confeſſe, that <hi>Paul</hi> ſpoke properly in the 5 chapter to the <hi>Romans,</hi> of the guilt and imputation of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin; and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſin, not as the fountain of humame corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but as it involves <hi>Adam,</hi> and in him all men in the ſame guilt: For the Apoſtle did not write, that men were corrupted in <hi>Adum,</hi> but ſinn'd in him: That they ſinn'd in <hi>Adam,</hi> by imputation,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:62635:170"/>not ſince <hi>Adam</hi> by imputation: That they ſinn'd <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And <hi>Adam</hi> is ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that place the head of all men, not natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but myſtically. And one excellent Divine ſpeaks very fitly to this place. <hi>By natural reaſon,</hi> ſays he, <hi>It cannot be, that all men who were not yet born ſinn'd in</hi> Adam; <hi>Unleſſe</hi> Adam <hi>in his moral exiſtence be ſuppoſed the Prince of all men.</hi> For which cauſe, the Apoſtle ſays in the ſame chapter, not of thoſe ſins by which <hi>Adam</hi> was corrupted naturally, and by which all men are naturally cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted; but of one offence, one ſin, one diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, which deſerv'd a guilt to <hi>Adam,</hi> and in him to all men, and which not actually, but by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation paſſ'd upon all men: <hi>By which means,</hi> ſays Cardinal <hi>Bellarmin, That diſobedience might be communicated to all men:</hi> And the famous <hi>Gamach</hi> of <hi>Sorbon. We grant</hi> ſays he, <hi>That the actual ſin of</hi> Adam, <hi>as actual, was not in men, but by imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gn.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Law, or the tranſgreſſion of the Law, cauſ'd the imputation of that ſin: Nature begat the real inherence of habitual ſin, which is wickedneſſe of Nature. Nature and Law are quite different in the ſcheme of things. God the Creator of all things produced nature: The ſame God, the reſtorer, or ſecond creator, made the Law; And as nature could not contract a guilt from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers fault, as the violation of the Law might doe: ſo neither guilt, by the violation of the Law, and by anothers fault, could corrupt Nature. A moral cauſe, ſuch as was the diſobedience of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
                     <pb n="316" facs="tcp:62635:171"/>could not produce a natural corruption. Therefore much leſſe could the imputation of that diſobedience produce that corruption. Tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Therefore the Apoſtle coupled not theſe things thus diſ-joyned, and which can no way agree one with another, Nature and Law, Sin by Nature, and Guilt by Law, in this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe which he here intended concerning that ſin, which in the tranſgreſſion of <hi>Adam</hi> was imputed to all men.

                  <head type="sub">How the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> was cauſe of mens ſalvation, not condemnation. Since the death of Christ no mans ſin is imputed to another, but every own bears his own ſin.</head>
                  <p>THat queſtion which is commonly diſputed concerning original ſin, is intricate, dark, and difficult, upon preſuppoſition, that all men were born of <hi>Adam.</hi> Upon my ſuppoſition, if God give me leave, I will make it ſo plain and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, that we ſhall never have any difficulty.</p>
                  <p>There are ſome that throw hatred upon God, according to the firſt ſuppoſition, in ſaying that
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:62635:171"/>his Law was too rigid and cruel, in that he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted that which was done by <hi>Adam,</hi> without the knowledge of men, before they had a being, to all mankind; and in that the puniſhments for that ſin were ſo heavy, that the whole nature of man was over-run with puniſhments and plagues. For by no humane Laws was there e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any ſucceſſors appointed of others crimes. <hi>Let Children,</hi> ſays <hi>Plato, not ſuffer for the wickedneſs of their Parents.</hi> It ſeem'd a cruel and pernicious preſident to the Senate of <hi>Rome</hi> to deſtroy <hi>Caſſius</hi>'s children, when <hi>Caſſius</hi> the Offender himſelf was deſtroyed; &amp; people who did endeavour to ſettle ſuch ways of puniſhment, ſeemed to do things worthy the hatred of men, and the anger of the Gods: But this ſeems to exceed all kind of cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, that after a miſerable and tormenting life, men ſhould be caſt into a burning lake, and give their enlivened liver again to be gnawn by worms, and there in weeping and gnaſhing of teeth to die, and never die, for ever, and beyond eternity.</p>
                  <p>To which inconveniences, that from my ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition I may briefly and clearly anſwer and ſtop every mouth ſpeaking irreverently of God: It is before ſufficiently ſhown, that the imputation of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, added nothing to the nature of man, given to corruption, which is meerly myſtical, and is only conceived in ſpirit; therefore, as to nature that imputation added, no new buſineſſe. We muſt here conſider what damage men receiv'd in this, according to myſtery; We muſt firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve, that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> where he ſays in
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:62635:172"/>the 10 to the <hi>Romans. That Chriſt is the end of the Law.</hi> Meant, that Chriſt was the end of all myſteries; both which were commanded by the Law, and contained in the books of the Prophets: In which ſignification, the Law is very frequent, and is taken for the whole Bible. <hi>Let it be ſo,</hi> ſaith the Lord to St. <hi>John,</hi> refuſing to baptize him, <hi>for thus it becoms us to fulfill all-truth.</hi> Truth in that place is the myſterie; For Chriſt fulfilled all myſteries, which he perfected, and accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed the ends of them: Beſides myſtery is called <hi>truth,</hi> becauſe all myſteries ordain'd by God lead to truth. Nor is myſterie an empty name, and a bare title or fiction, without its reallity and ſpecies: Yea it accompliſhes the chiefeſt thing of all, in that it begets truth, ſalvation, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality to men, which ſhall be cleared in its own place.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt was the chief end of that myſterie, by which the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> was imputed to men, that to them the juſtice of Chriſt, which is the death of Chriſt might be imputed. You muſt alſo take notice, that Chriſt is Jeſus, who is the Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, to whom the deſtroyer is oppoſ'd, and that is Antichriſt, the deſtroyer of men; Jeſus came to ſave men, not to deſtroy them. But as Chriſt was ordained the end to the ſalvation of man, their were mediums appointed to bring them to that end, for the accompliſhment of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned ſalvation. The imputation then of the ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> which brought us to that end, was the cauſe of our ſalvation, not our deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; Therefore that diſpenſation of the divine
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:62635:172"/>Law, was firſt of meekneſſe and bounty, not of wrath and crueltie, by which men, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and being not yet born, had the guilt of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> imputed to them; For the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> was imputed to them without their knowledge, that the juſtice of Chriſt might be likewiſe impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them without their knowledge, which is the ſalvation of the Lord: Sin begat Juſtification by the ſame miracle as darkneſſe is ſaid to have produced light, and death raiſed up life.</p>
                  <p>They are much deceiv'd, who think that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal death enſued that condemnation of death, which was decreed upon the ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> For I think it is ſufficiently clear'd out of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Romans,</hi> whom to this purpoſe I cited in the former chapter, that the condemnation was not eternal, but bounded with ſome limits, That it was born with <hi>Adam,</hi> and ended with <hi>Moſes. Death reign'd from</hi> Adam <hi>to</hi> Moſes, ſays the Apoſtle; For that death followed the fate of ſin, and of the father of it, who begat it. The ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> began to reign from the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of the Law, which I therefore call a legal ſin: Legal ſin liv'd as long as the Law liv'd, and when the Law was extinct, that was likewiſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed. That legal death reign'd as long as the Law reign'd, and behoved to die alſo when the Law died. Eternity alſo is indefinite, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal death had its certain limits, <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> beyond which it could not remain. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that death could not confer an eternity up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on men, which it ſelf had not,</p>
                  <p>What then ſhall we ſin, becauſe we are not
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:62635:173" rendition="simple:additions"/>under the Law, and becauſe there is now no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation remaining by the Law, which may hinder our deſign of ſinning? Far be it, ſays the Apoſtle. And that this objection may be quite ſatisfied. I think I ſhall doe very well to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the whole myſtery in order, and what I have ſpoken apart, to ſet down together, and repreſent it altogether to the view.</p>
                  <p>Reaſon, and holy Writ witneſſes, that all things are corruptible and mortal, which are compoſed of mortal and corruptible matter; And that men being made of matter mortal and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible, by virtue of their mortal and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble creation, could not aſcend up to an incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible and immortal God, to become themſelves immortal and incorruptible.

Men that are in the fleſh cannot pleaſe God; For the fleſh is enmity to God, Is not ſubject to the Law of God, nor can be. And a thouſand ſuch things we read in the Scripture: By which it appears, the vitiouſneſſe of the fleſh, matter, and creation of man ought to be redreſt, and that men ought to be transformed to new creatures; that of evil they might become good; of corruptible, incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible; of mortal, immortal, and poſſeſſe the Kingdom of God; <hi>Which fleſh and blood,</hi> which is corruption, <hi>cannot poſſeſſe.</hi> Cor. 1.

                  <p>Men that were to be transform'd and new cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, behov'd to die, as we have ſhown you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And God decreed that they ſhould all die in his Chriſt, who in forming a humane body, and dying for them by proxie, might alter the forms of men, and change them into new creatures: Which could not be done, but by myſterie, by the vertue of which they might be thought dead in Chriſt, whoſe bloud had ſprinkled them; and as the Dyers of red colours, ſuch garments as they intend of a crimſon, or ſcarlet dye, they firſt work them, rub them, and ſtain them with woad, that they may prepare a convenient reception for red colour, that faſtens to the woad, which is the ground of it: So it behov'd men by the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Adami</hi> ſin, firſt of all, as it were with woad, or the firſt ground, be wrought &amp; drench'd, that they might more fully ſuck up the bloud of Chriſt, and after the ſecond colouring, be of a more perfect dye. Therefore the imputation of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin was a preparative for the ſuſception of juſtice, which flow'd from the bloud of Chriſt, by which preparation all men thirſting, might more earneſtly ſeize upon his juſtification, and receive it inwardly.</p>
                  <p>And as ſcarlet dye added to the wool drench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in, takes away the ſtain of the woad, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhes the woad it ſelf: ſo likewiſe the blood of Chriſt caſt upon the ground of <hi>Adams</hi> impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, took away the imputation of ſin, and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly extinguiſh'd the ſin it ſelf, ſo that by the death of Chriſt there is no imputation of that ſin. <hi>Sin was before the Law, but it was not imputed

Chriſt dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, cut off that head of ſin which was after the Law, and that wound unto death was not cured; for that head was quite cut off, and pluck'd from its neck. After the death of Chriſt there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther head, which was before the Law. That ſin is extinguiſhed in the death of Chriſt, which was imputed to <hi>Adam,</hi> and in him to all men, by violation of the Law, which ſin I call legal. Since the death of Chriſt that ſin remains, which was not imputed whilſt the Law was not, which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally before the Law was inherent to all, which I now call natural.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt then reſtor'd men to that condition wherein <hi>Adam</hi> had found them, into the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſin not imputed by the Law, and men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came after the deſtruction of that Law, the very ſame thing before the Law was given to <hi>Adam;</hi> for another mans ſin is not imputed to any, ſince the death of Chriſt, but every one bears his own ſin. It is not now ſaid, as under the Goſpel, <hi>The faithers have eaten a ſowr grape, and the childrens

Every one dies not for the ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> but every one for his own ſin. <hi>Every one gives an account of himſelf to God,</hi> Rom. 14. <hi>Of himſelf,</hi> not of <hi>Adam,</hi> of his ſowr ſin in his own behalf, not of the ſtrong ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> which diligently obſerve, <hi>Every one carries his own burthen,</hi> Galat. 6. <hi>And every one obtains what he does in his own body.</hi> Cor. 2. chap. 5. <hi>God,</hi> under the Goſpel, <hi>judges the ſecrets of men,</hi> Rom. 2. <hi>The ſecrets of men,</hi> that is, their proper faults, their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd vices, every ones own ſin, and no mans elſe imputed to them Since the death of Chriſt, God imputes not ſins done againſt the Law, but aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribes to all men their natural ſins, which are not in the Law, but in the fleſh, and which reap corruption according to the nature of corrupt fleſh, which ſavour of death, in whom good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe dwells not, but on the contrary evil cleaves to them, and who not in regard of the Law, but in regard of their corrupt and mortal nature, can not poſſeſs the immortal and incorruptible king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God. The old <hi>Adam</hi> is crucified with Chriſt, and our old legal man; but our old natural man lives in us, which is really ours, and is not dead in the death of Chriſt, but ſhall by the vertue of his reſurrection, ſometimes, be extinguiſhed, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But in the mean time, let it be our buſineſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually to be in exerciſe of godlineſs, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring of our ſanctification, that the old ſin which adheres to our fleſh may be extinguiſh'd, and the juſtification of Chriſt may be reveal'd in us, from <hi>faith to faith,</hi> as it is written in the firſt of the <hi>Romans,</hi> that is, from ſanctification to ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification. For ſanctification is our true and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid faith in the concrete, here meant by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, not that idle and empty faith which ſome do urge in the abſtract. Let us not therefore ſin, becauſe we are no more confin'd by the Law of <hi>Adam,</hi> or by any puniſhment of death decreed ſince the Law of <hi>Adam,</hi> after Chriſts death, but becauſe really, and according to the nature of the buſineſs, we barricado our way to eternal life, and to the ſight and glory of God, if we indulge matter and our fleſh, and extinguiſh not ſin bred in us. No thought of cruelty then as to the Law of God, nothing diſſonant or inconvenient ſhall ariſe in our thoughts by the imputation of that le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> which enſued upon that tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, if all this buſineſs, according to my ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, be taken as a myſtical inſtitution, that it might prepare a fit ground for the reception of the juſtice of Chriſt, which is the ſanctification and ſalvation of men, and their chief happineſs, for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this myſtery, any thing which might have ſeem'd in God cruel againſt mankind, ſeems rather to have been deſign'd for the ſalvation of man.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Why <hi>Adam,</hi> who ſinn'd in the nature of a head, was not likewiſe puniſh'd in the nature of the head. The ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> was diſobedience. Natural and Legal ſin was the two-fold barricado against men, to ſhut them out of Paradiſe. Chriſt dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing broke the barr of the Law. Chriſt riſing again, and ſanctifying us, ſhall alſo break the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſin.</head>
                  <p>EXaminers uſe to be more ſevere in the puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of the actor, than in the puniſhing of the complices and partakers, which all Lawes teach us, both natural, civil, and Law of Nations, Nor needs this any proof, for it is already ſo often prov'd, that it would be clouded to cite all proofs; Only that Law held not in <hi>Adam,</hi> who, although he ſinn'd as the head, yet he was not puniſh'd as the head for his ſin. For, if all ſin and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, all feavers and plagues, and eternal death it ſelf, as it is believ'd, enterd into the world; and paſs'd upon all men, Why was not <hi>Adam</hi> readieſt to ſin amongſt all men, being the head and cauſe of all ſins, by reaſon of his tranſgreſſion? Why was not he ſeized himſelf with troops and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of all manner of plagues and fevers? And why was not that author of eternal death himſelf, given to eternal death? Yea, why did <hi>Adam,</hi> if we will except his ſingle tranſgreſſion, become famous for no other ſin? Yea, why did he enjoy his health ſo well? Why enjoyd he a long life
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:62635:177"/>nine hundred and thirty years, Why has none of the Divines ſent him to Hell, that amongſt the torments of the wicked and the damned, he might be puniſht with eternal death. But if on the contrary no man was ever partaker or conſcious with <hi>Adam</hi> of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin; yea if all men were purer from that ſin, then Children are free from ſin, as being not born when <hi>Adam dam</hi> ſinn'd, What was the reaſon thar men ſhould become more wicked by that ſin than <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> himſelf? For it is certain that a great many men have been thought more famous for the ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> then <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf, were ſore handled<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their life ſhort, and ſickly, and at laſt thrown down to hell, there to die an eternal death.</p>
                  <p>This darkneſs, from my ſuppoſition I will make as clear as day, if we conſider the ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againſt the Law, which was a legal ſin, or by default of his Nature ſubject to corruption; which is a natural ſin. If we conſider <hi>Adam</hi> ſining by a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal ſin or againſt the Law, which is the ſame thing; we ſhall conceive him, not only as to himſelf; but alſo in regard of all men, and to all mankind, whom he did repreſent; by force and virtue of which repreſentation, he deſerved the imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that ſin to himſelf and all Mankind. For as an Ambaſſadour who yeilds up a people to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering Prince in the name of his Country, does not only bind in his rendition himſelf, but all the people of the City, whom the Ambaſſadour repreſents: So <hi>Adam,</hi> in regard that he did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent all mankind, did not only bind himſelf, but all mankind to the decree which went out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:62635:177"/>his ſin, and made them and himſelf parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the ſame ſin: And as in the buſineſſe of rendition which the Ambaſſadour does in the behalf of his Country, all are equally obliged to the Laws of it, as well the Ambaſſadour, as all men of the Country; Juſt ſo in the buſineſſe of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin; all mankind did equally fall into the imputation. And as this rendition according to the School men, is neither leſſe nor more in one than another; nor of all thoſe that are yeilded, none is more engaged to it than another: Iuſt ſo the imputation of the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> admits not of a more, or a leſſe; nor can the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> be thought to be imputed more or leſſe to any man that ever was, or is, or ſhall be: And <hi>Lucans</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion might be very fit in this caſe: <hi>It ſtains and equals all;</hi> Yea <hi>Adam</hi> and all men that ever were made, or ſhall be, have ſuffered alike for that ſin, for all have equally endured the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of death decreed againſt that ſin; and all thoſe men were thought to be dead alike, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that legal, ſpiritual, and myſtical death, which enſued upon that legal, ſpiritual, and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical ſin.</p>
                  <p>If we conſider <hi>Adam</hi> ſinning in the default of his Nature given to corruption, which is natural ſin; then we ſhall conceive him in regard of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, not in regard of all men: And in that regard the more that <hi>Adam</hi> ſinn'd to himſelf in that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſin he gain'd himſelf more natural evil and puniſhment, and ſo had fall'n into more grievous diſeaſes. And indeed, becauſe natural ſin is recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of more or leſſe, according to mans nature,
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:62635:178"/>more or leſſe corrupt, as likewiſe all natural pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments admit of more or leſſe, and all natural evils which enſue upon that natural ſin: And as <hi>Adam</hi> beyond all other men was of a leſſe corrupt nature by the prerogative of his creation, which he had from God himſelf; ſo ſinn'd he leſſe than other men in natural ſin; And was leſſe puniſhed for his natural ſin; and ſuffered fewer evils than other men ſuffered; yea fewer than they for the ſelf ſame ſin now ſuffer.</p>
                  <p>Let us examine this buſineſſe on the right bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of reaſon, that it may appear beyond all controverſie, that the ſins of all men, and all thoſe evils and plagues which puniſh men, and their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal death, which hinders them from eternal life, to have flow'd from the fault of their own nature, inherent to them, and not from the ſin of <hi>Adam.</hi> Whence I pray that thirſt of blood, by which one man is a wild beaſt to another, one man kills another; is it not from black choler, with which mans liver ſwells? whence all thoſe inceſtuous marriages contrary to Law; whence unlawfull venerie, and thoſe wild luſts by which men run upon beaſts raſhly, not from perverſe and corrupt luſt, which is the itch of perverſe and corrupt nature, whence rapine and theft, <hi>whence war and ſtrife amongſt you</hi> ſays St. <hi>James</hi> in his 4 Chapter of his Epiſtle; <hi>are they not from your luſts?</hi> And hence we chiefly gather, that ſuch vices are altogether tyed and addicted to the ſubſtance of men; ſince the ſame ſubſtance is to men and beaſt, and men and beaſt have the ſame vices. Hence it is they call murtherers cruel perſons, Tigers,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:62635:178"/>Bears, Lions; Luſtfull perſons, Goats; Backbiters, Dogs, Thieves, Kites, and Eagles tallons; Belly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gods, hogs, &amp;c. Becauſe we believe that the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> was imputed to beaſts, and engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſuch vices alſo in them.</p>
                  <p>Whence is it likewiſe that men have their health ſo? that they are girt with the ſpleen as with a girdle? whence have they the Kings evil? whence bleer'd eyes? their guts ake? the roots of their hearts are periſhed? whence have they theſe continual, uncertain, or Periodical Fevers? whence ſo many ſorts of the Gout? and either the ſtone or gravel in the Kidneys, which occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons a ſtrangurie, and other ſeveral ſorts of diſeaſes by which mens bodies are tormented? are they not from the ill diſpoſitions of mens bodies? which are higher or leſſe grievous in humane bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as the badneſſe of their affections is either lightned or remitted: But certainly varieties of ſins or health, which make men either ill or diſeaſed, do plainly ſhew that all this vitiouſneſs ſprings from our nature, and from the ſubſtance of men, which as it is diverſly affected to divers, by either leſſe or more it is corrupted and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled: Neither could the legal ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> ever bring any ſuch thing to paſſe: For it is but one, and not vicious; and paſſed not upon men, either more intenſe, or more remiſs, but made all men alike guilty; and had made all men alike evil, and alike bad, and had put all men in the ſame kind and condition for ſin and death; if the ſins and diſeaſes of men had taken their originals from that one and one kind of ſin.</p>
                  <pb n="332" facs="tcp:62635:179"/>
                  <p>It is objected to this, that <hi>Adam</hi> when he tranſgreſſed the Law, did ſin naturally, for he naturally deſired the forbidden fruit, and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally did eat of it; Therefore the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> was natural not legal only. And therefore not only by myſtical and ſpiritual imputation, but by Nature alſo, and traduction from <hi>Adam,</hi> it paſſed upon all men. I anſwer, that <hi>Adam</hi> did not therefore ſin, becauſe he naturally deſired the fruit, and naturally did eat it; but becauſe he deſired it againſt Gods command, and eat it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his Law. The Apoſtle calls the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> diſobedience moral, not natural; or as there was a formality, not a materiality in that ſin: I ſay a formality, morality, and myſtery, which alone was imputed to <hi>Adam,</hi> and to all men, and for which he gained death to himſelf, and to all men: The nature and materiality of that ſin was properly no ſin; For of it ſelf, and naturally, it was no ſin to covet and eat that fruit <hi>which was fair to the eye, and good to eat,</hi> as <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> witneſſes of it: The force of that ſin conſiſted only in the tranſgreſſion and diſobedience of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> which was the formality and morality of that ſin.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, that ſin was two manner of ways impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>Adam;</hi> Either in that by his corrupt mind and will he tranſgreſſed the Law of God, or in ſo much as corporally, or by eating he broke it; In ſo far as <hi>Adam</hi> by his corrupted mind and will broke the Law, which was the formality, and the ſpirituality of his ſin, he deſerv'd that condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation ordained by the Law of God, &amp; ſo dyed the
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:62635:179"/>death a moral and a ſpiritual death, which Chriſt really, and in his body ſuffered for <hi>Adam.</hi> In ſo far as <hi>Adam</hi> in his body tranſgreſſed, he was in his body thruſt out of Paradiſe; <hi>leſt perhaps,</hi> ſays <hi>Geneſis, he ſhould put out his hand and take the tred of life, and live for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Both theſe happened to <hi>Adam</hi> by this tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, death, and thruſting out of Paradiſe: but both ſignificatively, parabolically, and by ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. All men dyed by the ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> by the ſame ſpiritual and myſtical death by which <hi>Adam</hi> dyed. All men were thrown out of Paradiſe not actually and corporally as <hi>Adam</hi> was, but ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catively, and myſtically. The nature of Man corrupt and ſubject to death, debarr'd men of the Paradiſe of God which is eternal life. The Law given to <hi>Adam</hi> did double barricado the way to this Paradiſe, <hi>and added ſtrength to that ſin,</hi> as ſays the ſecond Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> which that ſin brought to paſſe, <hi>making it exceeding ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,</hi> as the Epiſtle to the <hi>Rom.</hi> ſpeaks. And man had two ſtops to eternal life, the default of his nature, and the rigour of Gods Law; which was drawn, and offered the ſharp edge to all that ſhould offer to enter into Paradiſe. The nature of men given to corruption was the firſt and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial ſtop, their own impediment which hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red mans entrance into immortality. The Law violated by <hi>Adam</hi> was the ſecond and the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual hindrance, not an innate, but an impediment by another, which ſhut up Paradiſe, and which not naturally, nor by traduction from <hi>Adam;</hi> but which by imputation, ſpirit, and meer fiction of
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:62635:180"/>divine myſteries was objected to all men, that upon the ſame account they might loſe eternal life: Chriſt dying for us, took away the ſecond ſpiritual hindrance, which by <hi>Adams</hi> ſin was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us. The firſt natural and material ſtop yet remains, and ſhall be removed by Chriſt alſo, when he ſhall ariſe again, and ſanctifie us. All that are dead, and are mortal, are thrown out of Paradiſe, and ſhut out of eternal life by the ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> myſtically and parabolically, that by the reſurrection of the ſame Chriſt, they might enter into the ſame Paradiſe, and enjoy eternal life, not myſtically nor Parabolically; but truly and really; all, I mean, that ſhould be choſen to it.</p>

                  <head type="sub">All men have ſinned according to the ſimilitude of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi> ſin. Infants have ſinned according to the ſame ſimilitude.</head>
                  <p>THe Apoſtle writes, that <hi>Adam</hi> was a type of Chriſt, Chriſt was then a prototype of <hi>Adam,</hi> but by way of ſimilitude of <hi>Adam</hi> with Chriſt his prototype. And in regard as Chriſt who was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore what <hi>Adam</hi> had loſt, was not the laſt of all men, to comprehend men that were only paſt in his grace and juſtification, no more needed <hi>Adam</hi> to be the firſt of all men, to involve all men that were after him only in the imputation of his ſin. And as the death of Chriſt the prototype, was imputed to all men, both who liv'd in Chriſts time, and who were from all time before him, and thoſe that have been ſince Chriſt, and ſhall be born to the end of all time, by the ſame type and ſimilitude of the Prototype, the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> was imputed to all men, thoſe who liv'd in the dayes of <hi>Adam,</hi> and who were born before <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> and ſhall be born to eternity, and the one ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> caus'd all men, both ſince and before, to be condemned.</p>
                  <p>And that was it which the Apoſtle ſpoke very palpably in the ſame chapter, 15. Rom. where he ſays, <hi>That death reign'd from Adam unto Moſes, upon thoſe alſo that had not ſinned according to the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of the tranſgreſſion of Adam. Upon thoſe who had not ſinn'd;</hi> which words, are no doubt to be
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:62635:181"/>underſtood of thoſe men that were born before <hi>Adam.</hi> Men that were born before <hi>Adam</hi> did ſin. The men that were born after him ſinn'd. Men that were ſinners according to the ſimilitude of the tranſgreſſion of <hi>Adam,</hi> born before <hi>Adam.</hi> Men that were born after <hi>Adam,</hi> ſinn'd acording to his ſimilitude.</p>
                  <p>Which to open up in order, we muſt obſerve that never no man ſinned actually, as <hi>Adam</hi> ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but that it was actually imputed to all; for no man, as I ſaid before, did actually eat the fruit of the tree of good and evil; which according to the common opinion, no mortal men ever ſaw, nor could ſee; for the tree was remov'd from the ſight of all men, ſo ſoon as <hi>Adam</hi> was thruſt out of Paradiſe. But if no man could actually ſin, as <hi>Adam</hi> did, and yet all ſinn'd as <hi>Adam</hi> did, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, that all ſinn'd, according to the ſimilitude of that ſin, by the imputation of it. Certainly all Orthodox Divines agree upon what I ſaid before, That to impute to any one anothers ſin, is to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem him as the committer of it. In which it is requiſit, that one of the perſons have not commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it: otherwiſe, not another mans ſin, but his own ſhall be imputed to him. And it is certain, that the adventitious ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> was imputed to all men: We muſt therefore think, that all men were eſteem'd in the ſame condition, as if they had perform'd that ſin not actually; for then no mans ſin ſhould be imputed to any one, but his own. It remains then, that all men have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> according to ſimilitude, if not actually. And indeed, becauſe there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:62635:181"/>in the world, which is not either the thing actually, or the ſimilitude of it, which is the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of reality: Nor could there be any lawfull imputation from the ſin of another, but by that ſuppoſition; by which he who is put in place of the ſinner, is thought to be transform'd into his image and ſimilitude, and to have ſinn'd that by ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, which the other ſinn'd actually: ſo that for the ſimilitude ſuch puniſhments may be laid upon the perſonater of the guilty perſon, as were ordained for himſelf.</p>
                  <p>This the Apoſtle maintains to have happen'd to all men, and to have ſinn'd as <hi>Adam</hi> ſinn'd, and to have ſuffer'd the ſame death which <hi>Adam</hi> ſuffer'd for his ſin, <hi>By one man,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>ſin entred into the world, and by ſin, death:</hi> I ſay, he would have all men turn'd into the image and ſimilitude of the tranſgreſſion of <hi>Adam,</hi> that they might all be thought to have ſinn'd, according to the ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of the tranſgreſſion of <hi>Adam,</hi> and the like death reign'd over them, which reign'd over him, for the ſimilitude of his tranſgreſſion. And the Apoſtle, that none might be freed from the death of this puniſhment, adds, <hi>That death reign'd from</hi> Adam <hi>upon thoſe alſo who had not ſinn'd, according to the ſimilitude of the tranſgreſſion of</hi> Adam: For it was known before, that the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon all men which had been born ſince the framing of <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſhould be born afterwards, and that death reign'd from him upon his poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But that he might comprehend all men in the ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> whoſe roots reached as far from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> to the foregoing ages, as their branches rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:62635:182"/>from <hi>Adam</hi> to the future ages, and the times after <hi>Adam:</hi> It was the meaning of the Apoſtle, that the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> was indifferently imputed to all men, before and ſince, and that death reign'd from him upon thoſe that were paſt, and thoſe that were to come. A wonderful, but no ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar myſtery. For the faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted by the ſame myſtery to all the faithful, both born before <hi>Abraham</hi> from all eternity, and who were born after <hi>Abraham,</hi> and ſhall be born to all eternity; in which ſenſe <hi>Abraham</hi> is called the father of the Faithfull, of thoſe that are paſt, and are alſo to come. To theſe add what I have ſaid of the imputation of the death of Chriſt, That the death of Chriſt was not only imputed to all men born after Chriſt, but paſt back upon all thoſe like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe born before Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>And as it was fit it ſhould be, ſo likewiſe the manner of the myſtical imputation perſwades us, that it was ſo, ſpiritually I mean, and by way of conception, according to which, myſtical impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation takes hold of men: For as Lightning brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king out of a cloud enlightens with one flaſh things above it, and things below it: So the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation that broke out of the ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one and the ſame lightning upon all men, thoſe that were born after <hi>Adam,</hi> and thoſe that were born before him. And the ſame manner of myſterie, which may teach us, that the death of <hi>Adam</hi> paſſ'd upon all men that were not born many ages after <hi>Adam,</hi> will teach us, that death could reign backward upon thoſe that were born before him never ſo long. For the manner
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:62635:182"/>of imputation is alike for the time paſt, and for the time to come. Nor is there any new miracle to be ſought for, that ſin ſhould be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to men created before <hi>Adam,</hi> if it be believ'd to be imputed to men created after <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let us, as far as we conceive, view all men from the beginning to the end. And at laſt you will confeſs, that no other could ſin, but according to the ſimilitude of the tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Adam;</hi> but only thoſe that were begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and born before <hi>Adam.</hi> For it is certain, that all men after <hi>Adam,</hi> and their ſons, and who ſhall alſo be by them begotten, did ſinn according to the ſimilitude of the tranſgreſſion of <hi>Adam,</hi> What kind of men muſt thoſe be, I beſeech ye, who did not ſin according to the ſimilitude of the tranſgreſſion of <hi>Adam?</hi> Certainly it muſt be thoſe who were born be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Adam;</hi> becauſe the Apoſtle ſayes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly, they ſinn'd before the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. And to whom, before the Law and <hi>Adam,</hi> their ſin was not imputed, becauſe ſin is not imputed when the Law is not. And therefore they neither ſinn'd nor could ſin according to the ſimilitude of the tranſgreſſion of <hi>Adam.</hi> To make the difference betwixt them and all the poſterity of <hi>Adam,</hi> who ſinn'd after the Law, becauſe after <hi>Adam,</hi> to whom the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> was imputed. becauſe ſin began to be imputed from the Law, and from <hi>Adam;</hi> and who could ſin only according to this real
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:62635:183"/>ſimilitude of the tranſgreſſion of <hi>Adam,</hi> of which we here ſpeak, and which, no doubt, the Apoſtle meant.</p>
                  <p>Let famous men pardon me that have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded St. <hi>Paul</hi> upon this place, if I tell them, that thoſe things which they ſpeake concerning children here, are inconſiſtent, whom they would have here to be the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons meant, who ſinn'd not according to the ſimilitude of the tranſgreſſion of <hi>Adam,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſinn'd not actually as <hi>Adam</hi> did; Yea, if they had ſinn'd actually, they had not ſinn'd according to ſimilitude, becauſe act is the reality of a thing, no ſimilitude: And in that very regard, becauſe infants ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not actually, they muſt needs ſin accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to ſimilitude. But the mixture of thoſe natural ſins of <hi>Adam,</hi> deceiv'd thoſe moſt famous men, which were inherent to him; together with that legall ſin which paſſed upon all men. For they imagin'd that chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſinn'd not according to the ſimilitude of the tranſgreſſion of <hi>Adam,</hi> becauſe they ſinn'd not actually as <hi>Adam</hi> ſinn'd. As for example. Becauſe they kill'd not actually, as <hi>Adam</hi> kill'd, or might have kill'd; becauſe they committed not adultery actually, as <hi>Adam</hi> did, or might have done; becauſe they ſtole not actually, as <hi>Adam</hi> ſtole, or might have ſtollen: and ſo of the reſt of <hi>Adams</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſins. But here there was no intention concerning the ſimilitude of all his natural ſins,
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:62635:183"/>but only of the ſimilitude of his diſobedience. Into which diſobedience no man nor no child could ever fall actually. The Apoſtle ſaid not, <hi>Who had not ſinn'd according to the ſimilitude of</hi> Adams <hi>ſins.</hi> Nay that only, <hi>Who had not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned according to the ſimilitude of</hi> Adams <hi>tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaeſſion.</hi> For here he intended nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning all the ſins of <hi>Adam,</hi> and thoſe natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſins of <hi>Adam</hi> which only concern'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but of that one tranſgreſſion that paſſed upon all men: All, I ſay, both of age and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der age, as all men are indifferently compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in the ſpecies; and in regard that old and young, and men of all ages ſinned in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and myſterie, not naturally and material<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, according to the ſimilitude of the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of <hi>Adam.</hi> For although there be a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſimilitude of all mens ſins with the ſins of <hi>Adam;</hi> yet the Apoſtle meant not that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial and natural ſimilitude here, wherein we may alſo communicate with the beaſts, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to whoſe ſimilitude, all men ſin na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally and materially, by reaſon of their commmon nature and matter. St. <hi>Paul</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned only that myſtical and ſpiritual ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, which only man is capable of, Men, I ſay, who have alſo a ſpiritual and myſtical com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Chriſt; to which communion to ſay that beaſts could come, were wickedneſs.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. IX.</head>
                  <head type="sub">How the imputation of the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted backward, and upon the predeceſſors of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> by a myſtery provided for their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. How the predeceſſors of <hi>Adam</hi> could be ſav'd.</head>
                  <p>BUt how could, ſay they, the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> be imputed backward. And how could death reign back upon them that were alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy dead. Nor ought it ſeem a wonder to any, that the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> was imputed backward, conſidering what I have often inculcated, That the faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> according to the conſent of all Divines, was imputed to the Predeceſſors of <hi>Abraham,</hi> though dead, and that Chriſt was imputed to all, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore himſelf, and <hi>Abraham,</hi> though dead and buried.</p>
                  <p>But yet it will ſeem prodigious, that death reign'd back from the imputation of the ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> conſidering that no death could hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to men, but that which deſcended upon men by the ſeed of <hi>Adam,</hi> which as they ſay, became mortal, and begat death, ſince <hi>Adam</hi> ſinn'd; For grant this, and it is impoſſible to imagine that death paſſ'd upon all men by the ſeed and ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> becauſe it is impoſſible to be done, and impoſſible to be conceiv'd, that
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:62635:184"/>
                     <hi>Adam</hi> did beget his predeceſſors. But if we conſider that death, which paſſed from <hi>Adam</hi> upon all men, to be myſtical and ſpiritual, which not materially nor naturally, but my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtically and ſpiritually returned upon all men, that will be very clear. For, as we conceive that death invaded <hi>Adam,</hi> and all after him, that very hour when he ſinn'd, Why ſhould we not think that death ſeiz'd alſo all before and all after? And if there be any thing of impoſſibility to be ſpoken of the men that were before, Why ſhould there not be the ſame impoſſibility in thoſe that come af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? Yea, in this myſterie their ſhould be a greater regard had to thoſe who were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, than thoſe that came after. Becauſe thoſe which are dead, and are not, are in ſome condition thought to be, becauſe they were certainly; but thoſe who are to come, never were, and it may be never will have any being.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle tels us plain, That the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of death did vaniſh after the deſtruction of the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Law, or ſince Chriſt, which is the ſame. Let no man doubt, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that death reign'd upon all men who were begotten ſince Chriſt to our times, and upon thoſe that ſhall be begotten after us to the end of all time. The queſtion is, Since which time did death reign over thoſe that were born ſince Chriſt, and ſhall be born after him? Certainly not ſince the death
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:62635:185"/>of Chriſt, as is ſaid; For Chriſt dying, deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the kingdome of Death. Since that time then when the kingdome of death was in force. From <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſince that time, wherein <hi>Adam,</hi> and all men in <hi>Adam</hi> deſerv'd to die for their tranſgreſſion; who by <hi>Caſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi> are elegantly ſaid, <hi>To have deſerv'd death, before they taſted of life.</hi> Death then reign'd from <hi>Adam</hi> upon men that were to be, and were not yet born; which if it could, any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than myſtically, and meerly intellectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, let every body imagine. And what hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders us to have the ſame thoughts of men that are paſt, as we have of thoſe men that were to come? And we grant, that death reigned myſtically upon one, and that it did reign likewiſe myſtically upon the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>Likewiſe by way of myſtery, Parabolically, and in all ſuppoſition of Law, there will be more reaſon why death ſhould reign over thoſe that are paſt, than thoſe that are not born; if we call to mind the ways of Judges in Criminals, with whom it is no new thing to inflict a puniſhment upon the dead, who command the dead bodies of guilty perſons to be preſent at judgement, that according to the puniſhment of the Law they may ſuffer a civil death, which by a natural one they have prevented; But what Law is ſo cruel as to ordain any ſuch thing concerning men that never were? What Law condemns men not
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:62635:185"/>born, to die? Let us therefore think that a myſtical and ſpiritual death reign'd upon all the predeceſſors of <hi>Adam:</hi> Juſt as the Civil Law preſuppoſes thoſe that have dyed a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural death, may be alſo condemned to a civil death.</p>
                  <p>But any one may anſwer, Thoſe guilty perſons dyed a deſerved civil death, by the ſentence of the Judges, for breach of the civil Law. But thoſe men who dyed before <hi>Adam,</hi> and never did violate any Law, becauſe never none was given to them, how could they deſerve any ſuch thing at Gods hands? and what ſuch bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Law allow'd the Cuſtome to involve dead men in guilt, kill them over again, and add a legal death to their natural death, by a Law which they never tranſgreſſ'd? Let us never have any ſuch thought, that there is any ſuch injuſtice in God, or any cruelty in his Law, God forbid that any ſuch thing ſhould come into our minds: that God ſhould ever decree any thing that ſhould tend to their deſtruction, which we confuted before: Whatſoever God decreed concerning men, it is decreed for their ſalvation, and if there was any thing then which ſeem'd to them diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious, God would in his own time turn it to the beſt. Therefore God provided for thoſe men which were before <hi>Adam,</hi> that they ſhould die by the tranſgreſſion of <hi>Adam,</hi> that they might again riſe from the dead, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſpirit of ſanctification which is
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:62635:186"/>in Chriſt; They were ſav'd becauſe they peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed; And it had been thought a diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the myſtery, unleſſe thoſe who were in poſſibility to riſe again had periſhed: And both could be well enough performed upon them, to die in <hi>Adam,</hi> and riſe in Chriſt, by the mutual and reciprocal imputations of <hi>Adam</hi> and Chriſt, myſtically and ſpiritually underſtood, if we conceive the condemnation of death turn'd back upon them, in the ſame manner as we underſtand the abſolution from condemnation, by the ſatisfaction and death of Chriſt, myſtically and ſpiritually returned alſo.</p>
                  <p>Yea, they do object, How can ever the predeceſſors of <hi>Adam</hi> be ſanctified, and a riſe up to eternal life in Chriſt, if life eternal, which is the ſalvation of man, is granted to none but ſuch as know<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God the Father, and believed in Chriſt his Son, whom the Father ſent; But how could they either know God the Father, or believe in Chriſt his Son, who never heard any thing neither of Father nor Son; for knowlege and faith are by hearing? That I may anſwer this according to time and place, you muſt know, that all <hi>Adams</hi> Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors might preſume of their ſalvation; upon the ſame account as all the Patriarchs of the the Jews could conceive hope in their ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; For neither did thoſe Fathers of the Jews know God the Father, as Father, nor believed in Chriſt the Son, according to the Apoſtle,
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:62635:186"/>in the laſt Chapter of the <hi>Romans.</hi> The my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of God the Father and God the Son was <hi>hidden from eternity to our times;</hi> Therefore it was hid and unknown to all thoſe Patriarchs that were betwixt <hi>Adam</hi> and Chriſt: But if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mention the words of our Saviour, ſaying, that <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſay</hi> foreſaw the day of Chriſt, and were glad. I anſwer, they ſaw the day of Chriſts coming, but cloath'd in ſhadows and figures, as one
<q>Who ſees in clouds, or thinks he ſees the Moon.</q> They ſmil'd upon Chriſt, but knew him not; as Infants ſmile upon their Mothers, and whom by laughter they are ſaid to know, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther poetically than truly; for inſtinct it is rather in Children, than knowledge.</p>
                  <p>It is alſo written in the firſt Chapter to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> That God did chuſe the Gentiles to the Adoption of his own Sons, <hi>before the creation of the World:</hi> God forbid that we ſhould think that election was ſo unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and to ſo little purpoſe, which we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to be from eternity, to the framing of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> and ſo to Jeſus Chriſt, that none of all the Gentiles was elected and called to the participation of ſalvation which was in Chriſt, all that time which was betwixt the infancy of the world, till the death of Chriſt. <hi>Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dech</hi> was a Gentile, for he was not a Jew, which he has clearly ſet down in his Epiſtle to
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:62635:187"/>the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> chap. 7, verſe 6. <hi>And he was the Priest of the moſt high God.</hi> Therefore ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted; yea, a veſſel of moſt choice election, who received the tenths from <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to whoſe eternal Prieſthood the eternal Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of Chriſt is compared. <hi>Iob</hi> is thought to be a Gentile, a man ſingle and upright, fearing God, and departing from evil, a ſervant of God; and therefore choſen, and to whom, as God ſays himſelf, there was not the like upon earth. <hi>Cornelius</hi> the Centurian of the <hi>Italian</hi> legion, was a Gentile, a man pious, and fearing God with his whole houſhold, and given to good works. I paſſe by a great many Proſelites, as alſo thoſe Gentiles whom <hi>Mothanus Vuyerius</hi> the <hi>Chiron</hi> of our <hi>Achilles</hi> makes a long Catalogue of, in his elegant and and learned Treatiſe <hi>of the vertue of Heathens;</hi> I ſay I paſſe by all thoſe good, approved, and wiſemen, whom long before the death of Chriſt its probable, yea we may very well believe, were choſen by God, and called un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord; But in the ſame account were after <hi>Adam</hi> to Chriſt, in the ſame account I ſay were thoſe Gentiles in the firſt age, from the creation of the world, till the framing of <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For this cauſe I think that all thoſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles begotten before and after <hi>Adam,</hi> good and meek men, to have been Chriſts chief, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I believe they were the bondmen and ſervants of Chriſt. <hi>For if any had the ſpirit of
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:62635:187"/>Christ, he was Chriſts,</hi> as ſays the Apoſtle <hi>Romans</hi> 8. I think they had the Spirit of Chriſt, becauſe I think they were touched and inſpired by the ſpirit of Chriſt, which by ſecret operations and thoughts, wrought in them ſalvation to life eternal. The ſpirit of Chriſt was in the Gentiles, as the ſoul is in Infants, by which they are ſenſible, and which the Infants perceive; but are not ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of it. The ſpirit of Chriſt was in them as reaſon is in Children, which is in them a power to become reaſonable; but as yet not brought in to act. Therefore is that ſpirit called, <hi>the power of God unto ſalvation.</hi> Rom. chap. 1. The ſpirit of Chriſt was in them; as in a grain of Corn, there is a vegetative power; <hi>For that grain of Corn grows and increaſes in the earth, without the knowledge of the Husbandman who ſowed it.</hi> Which is obſerved in the Goſpel according to St. <hi>Mark:</hi> For this cauſe the ſpirit of Chriſt, which is the kingdom of God, is compared to the grain of Corn: For that ſpirit which is in the elect, grows and increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, whilſt the elect, in whom it is, know not of it. That ſpirit of Chriſt was given to the Gentiles, not knowing, being ſupine and aſleep, to whom that of the 127 Pſalm agree<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed very well: <hi>When he ſhall give his beloved ſleep; Behold the inheritance of the Lord?</hi> The inheritance of the Lord, which is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, the ſpirit of Chriſt, and life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal.
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:62635:188"/>The ſpirit of Chriſt was in them, but it was hidden and unknown, nor revealed it ſelf unto them. They felt and worſhipped that ſpirit; they felt that which they knew not, they worſhiped that which they were ignorant of; They dedicated Altars, which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated to the unknown God, which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known God St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf by name, did expound to the <hi>Athenians.</hi> The ſpirit of Chriſt was hidden in them, therefore were they elect unknown; as St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls others, <hi>Jews in ſecret,</hi> Romans 3. <hi>They were ſhut up to that faith which was to be revealed.</hi> Which St. <hi>Paul</hi> alſo affirms of thoſe holy Jews, who lived under the Law from <hi>Adam</hi> till Chriſt; and might be alſo well fitted to thoſe juſt Gentiles, who liv'd under Nature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Law and <hi>Adam.</hi> Thoſe Gentiles were like <hi>wandring ſheep, who knew not the ſhepheard that led them, but which,</hi> according to Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> in his ſecond Epiſtle, chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter 2. might be turned <hi>to the ſhepheard of their ſouls.</hi> They were hidden in their knowledge and profeſſion: and only ſo far known, as they could be diſcern'd by their workes, which was the true and real proof of their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection. As the Lord ſays, <hi>By their works you ſhall know them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>More of this I will ſpeake, if it ſhall pleaſe God; where I ſhall ſpeak of purpoſe concerning the calling of the Gentiles, which
<pb facs="tcp:62635:188"/>was in force after the rejection of the Jews. I will begin the ſecond Part of this Syſteme from the rejection of the Jews: Becauſe I have ſpoken enough of the Election of the Jews, and of the Gentiles elected in the Jews, and will ſpeak no farther of it.</p>
